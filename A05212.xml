            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I haue vnderſtood of your troubles, and doe take comfort in your conſtancie. Your cauſe is cleere: your religion that, which the ſonne of God hath taught. In former time no other was in England. So much you know by the Hiſtories and Chronicles of the country; ſo you haue ben told by your parents, who ſawe the profeſſion of it, with their owne eies; ſo your anceſtors doe teſtifie by their wills and graues. Your Churches there, were built for the exerciſe of it; as you can prooue by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme of them, by the croſſes and pictures, by the altars made for Maſſe. Euer ſince the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the country from Paganiſme by Sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine and his fellowes, monkes, it hath beene there, till of late: and S. Auguſtine brought it from
<pb facs="tcp:344:3"/> Rome, where it had beene common from the time of S. Peeter; and S. Peeter learned it of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are learned, if they will looke into the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, which diuers, and of late the worthy Cardinall Caeſar Baronius, haue compiled, may ſee there (looking vpwards to the Apoſtles time) this Religion deſcending thorough all ages, in ſacred eſteeme euer; the preachers, gods trumpets, proclaiming it; the generall councells ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king roome; the martyrs teſtifying the truth of it with their blood; the light of miracles accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it all the way; and worlds of people waiting on. The Societie of thoſe that profeſſe it, is the Church; and is diffuſed ouer the World, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: it is that Church which in your Creede you doe beleeue. This is the ſpouſe of the ſonne of God, the woman clad with the ſunne, manifeſt vnto all (that willfully do not shutte their eies) by her anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, cleere ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vniuerſality: and the twelue-fold Apoſtolicall glorie doth crowne her heade, or beginning. Shee hath beene oppoſed by diuers Hereſies, but ſtill gotte the victory, bringing foorth Saincts to Ieſus Chriſt in the labour of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>You know the counſell of the Scripture, Sonne, comming to the ſeruice of God, prepare thy ſoule to temptation, and the affirmation of the Apoſtle is generall, All thoſe that will liue godly shal ſuffer perſecut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To take the ſpoile of your goods with ioy is to enbrace and kiſſe your croſſe. There is no deliberation when I muſt leaue gold or god: no compariſon betwixt a diamond in a gold ring, and the deitie in eternitie. O my deare frinds! you haue each of you a Iewell within your ſelues, richer then all the eie can ſee without, fairer then the ſunne it ſelf, and farre aboue all the diſpoſition of the ſtars. The vſurers Idol, gold, waxeth pale, if you compare it, to the burning ſparkles of the chryſolite. In your Iewell you may ſee heauen and earth, in the compaſſe of the vnderſtanding. It hath engrauen in it the image of allmighty God; and is, for nature next an angell, by grace companion with him; as being to beare a part in the heauenly quire, and there without aſtonishment to ſing allelluia with thoſe thouſand thouſand glorious queriſters, if the fault be not yours.</p>
                  <p>The Soule, hauing free will, had once loſt it ſelf; you may, by the meanes taken to recouer it, know the worth. The ſonne of God, came from heauen downe to looke it, and redeemed it with that which is better then the world, his life.

If you looſe it now againe, you wrong his loue, you depriue him of his right, you moue his father (whoſe angry lookes are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire) to reueng. It is horrible to fall into the hands of the liuing God. The pillars of heauen do tremble and dreade at his beck. He hath mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the water with his fiſte, and pondered the heauens with a ſpanne. He looketh on the earth, and maketh it to tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble; toucheth the mountaines, and they ſmoke. If you keepe it well, he will make it a heauen, wherein he, with the father, and the holy Ghoſt, will dwell, foreuer.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O one, of the two papers which you had from me long agoe, you haue shaped, as it ſeemeth, a kind of anſwere; yet not an anſwere neither, for you ſend him that would haue one, to looke it in other men that are in print. For my part, I was not willing at the ſight of yours (which I eſpied by meere chaunce, and neuer ſawe but once) to be made an Aprill foole, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not be ſo farre at your commaund. Yet to declare that I was not ſatisfied, Preſumed the chiefe question, out of which the reſt are eaſilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued; and diſputed it more at large: putting downe the concluſions together with their grounds; and maintaining them againſt that which your ſelf, or your abettors haue obiected. I endeuoured to do this briefly; but it ſo fared with me in this intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall buſineſſe, as it doth with ſuch as breede: the child in the natiuitie is much bigger then at the conception: the matter I ſpeake of heere, hath an inward inclination to dilate it ſelf, and whilst I was writing, the diſcourſe prooued a booke. VVhere
<pb facs="tcp:344:7"/> vppon, being withall deſirous to impart it to my frinds, I determined to multiply my coppies by the print, when I could ſpare money to diſcharge it. As I was expecting that opportunitie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, ariſing out of the late perſecution, ſolicited me, to let it, without more delay, come abroade: and I haue yeelded thereunto, though not without diffitcultie. I will not addreſſe the thing particularly against you, partly becauſe I diſpute alſo against others, with whom I haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed ſome papers as I did with you, and am willing (if it may be) to be heard where they are: partly becauſe your diſcourſe was not a direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to that I ſent: and a poſting direction of half a sheete of paper, had beene as much, as in way of reply, it could deſerue from me, or any other. You had handled the matter ſo, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, I doubed whether I were the man you meant by the name there put downe: you knew me by another; and whether I had euer vſed that, I could not then readily call to mind. You will ſay peraduenture, that a circumstance tied your tongue. This may be: and therefore, bearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that way too, I will diſcouer you no further, but leaue you at your liberty: though otherwiſe, being out of the Kingdome, I might be more open then I am. You haue infinitely wronged your owne ſoule, in offering to drawe men from the communion
<pb facs="tcp:344:7"/> the Church: and to leade them into hereſies, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite directly to the word of God, and accurſed by the holy Ghoſt. Trouble not your ſelf any further to dreſſe vp ould shifts, that haue beene worne out long agoe. If you cannot prooue your cauſe poſitiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as none euer yet could, or will doe as long as God is truth) hold your peace. The more you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hereſie, the deeper a lodging you beſpeake your ſelf in hell. That you may eſcape that gulphe, I shewe you heere S. Peeters Shippe fairely vnder ſaile towards eternitie: and will reach you my hand, if you wil come into it.</p>

In theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heads the reſt are included, and theſe you name allwayes, and ſtand moſt vppon them. I am now by my promiſe, to bringe their grounds out of Sripture, wherein I will be as briefe as I can, and will begin with the neereſt which is the laſt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo backwards till I meete the firſt againe. Before I begine the taske two thinges are to be noted: The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that I am not in this Chapter to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tend about the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and meaning, if you pretend it is not that which the words offer immediately: but that my taske is donne if I bringe places of ſcripture which affirme formally (if the words be taken in their proper ſenſe) that which wee doe. A further Iudgment or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the meaning and ſenſe of the words I bringe, is to be taken from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Spirit: The <hi>Spirit</hi> (I ſay) <hi>is to be iudge of the ſenſe</hi> and meaning: not the ſpirit of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, or in them: but the ſpirit in Gods Church. And this Iudgment is euidently on
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:344:42"/> our ſide as I will prooue in the third booke. Here I am not to meddle with it: but only <hi>to finde our doctrine in the ſame or equiualent words,</hi> and to put it here downe. This you muſt beare in minde likewiſe for the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which in the third Chapter I made out of the Fathers. It ſuffiſed there againſt you to cite <hi>our doctrine</hi> out of <hi>their mouthes.</hi> Of their <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> muſt be <hi>Iudge.</hi> And, not the Spirit in externes: but the Spirit in the Church. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that, ſince to deſcend vnto particulars and to inquire each ones opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in matter of Religion among Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts is endles, and of infinite regard,<note place="margin">3.

Of Proteſtantes, (for I ſpeake now of the whole body ſuch as it is) ſome be Lutherans, ſome be Caluiniſts: in ſome things the Lutherans oppoſe the Scripture more then Caluiniſts: in other things the Caluiniſts
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:344:43"/> more then the Lutherans: in other <hi>both</hi> are oppoſite vnto Gods word. When you are on that ſide which doth conſent with vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my diſcourſe doth not proceede againſt you: yet then allſo, my argument holds, in as much as <hi>it is confeſſedly true</hi> that <hi>in thoſe points</hi> the Scripture is not againſt vs. If (I ſay) at any tyme you diſſent from your maſters whom I will name, and admit that they and their Spirit of interpretation are contrarie to the Scripture, you may interprete your ſelfe not to be included amongſt them I ſpeake vnto: But my argument will runne on againſt you for <hi>all the reſt</hi> of the points wherein you conſent and agree with them, which are all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all, in ſubſtance, howſoeuer there may be ſome litle Difference about the manner.

Compare this now to your Church, to your companie: which wee haue ſearched and hunted after in the former booke, but could not get tidings of, in all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Luther. I, in the meane tyme will on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looke out this Church of God. But firſt I would haue you to note, that as in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:344:59"/> naturall bodie there are many ſuperfluous materiall parts of flesh, fatte, and ſome other eauen in the hands, eares, and eies (as you ſee in men that are groſſe) which parts though they be coherent now, are not reſumed all in the reſurrection, becauſe they would exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and increaſe the bodie vnto more then the iuſt bignes of the man, and beyond the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall proportion of the ſoule: So in this myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, are many parts, which will not riſe with it vnto glorie: and therfore are multiplied aboue the number which is written in the booke of life: yet being called (as <hi>many are called, fewe choſen</hi>) for a tyme they doe beleeue; but they fall againe before they die. Another thing you may note if you pleaſe: that as the naturall bodie recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſowle when the principall parts are prepared, doth growe and flourish, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards looseth againe the exteriour beautie in ould age: So the Church receaued the Spirit when, by the inſtruction of the ſonne of God, the chiefe parts (the Apoſtles) were prepared, and then did extend it ſelfe in bignes, and flourished, but in her ould age, in the daies of Antichriſt she will looſe her exteriour beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and maieſtie, and be greeuouſlie afflicted, and perſecuted for a<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Church in the tyme of her extreame perſecution will be viſible, for perſecution it ſelfe is an euident argument of viſibility, as in England you ſee: At the ſame tyme she will be allſo Catholique and ſpred ouer the earth as S.

Men generally being demaunded which are Catholiques point at vs: and being asked which Church is the Catholique, do direct vnto <hi>that which is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Roman See.</hi> This was knowne to be the Catholique Church in the tyme of S.

Aske all Chriſtians ſuch only excepted as your ſelues condemne for heretiques, and they will tell you ſo.

               <p n="12">12. If a man should haue come to Luther
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:344:61"/> when he did looke round about for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and found none of his opinion, and should haue ſaid vnto him, Sir Luther, in the Bible there is an ample deſcription of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peruall Catholique Church, I pray you which is it, that I may be Chriſtian in communion of that Church; Your Doctor for his hart could haue directed to no other, then to <hi>that Congregation which then was in communion with the Byſshop of Rome.</hi> For to you, he could not haue directed him, becauſe, poore men, you were not in the world as yet, with your Religion, nor euer deſerued the name of Catholique, as in the former booke to your confuſion hath beene ſeene. To haue ſaid that he; a ſole man, was the Catholique Church, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeakes of, had bene to multiplie himſelfe ouer the world into many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and into millions of men at once. To the Iewes or Pagans he could with no face haue ſent him, and had he done ſo, they would haue giuen him the lie. It reſts therefore that Luther, and ſo Caluin, ſo Iewell, muſt haue dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him to vs, and haue tould him, the Catholique Church is that, which hath and ſtill had communion with the Roman See.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:344:61"/>13. I knowe ſome of your fellowes would ſend a man to the Grecians, and ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Aethiopians: but theſe are not Proteſtants, as the Grecians declare them ſelues, and by the Aethiopians doctrine he may ſee, that is not blind. Neither hath the Grecian beleefe in thoſe things wherein they differ from the Church of Rome, euer bene in the generall communion of the Chriſtian world, and therefore Greciſme is not, nor euer was Catholique: and the ſame it is of Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians, and all others. Another shift you haue, and this is to ſay the Catholique Church is inuiſible, among the Romans, the Grecians, Aethiopians, Germans, and others, but lies hid. This would trouble the man ſurely, for how ſhould he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by her, and imbrace her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vnles he could find her? and how should he finde her, if she did not appeare but were inuiſible? moreouer he would ſay, that the Church which the Scripture hath deſcribed is there alſo declared to be <hi>perpetually viſible,</hi> with <hi>gates euer open,</hi> the Paſtors alwayes <hi>exerciſing their holy fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and Gods <hi>word in their mouth euer:</hi> for this Church he doth inquire, shewe him this Church and he will trouble you no
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:344:62"/> longer, for the reſt he shall haue there. A third shift is to ſend him to the primitiue Church, and to tell him that indeede, then was this communion with all Nations, this ample Church which the Scripture doth commend, was then, but ſince it decaied; and now you are building it againe. This iourney were to longe for him; he is not able to reade bookes, otherwiſe he would not trouble you, nor your Congregation at all, for he should eaſilie find the thing himſelfe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he may be directed by the iudgment of other men better ſeene in that buſines, he deſires to know, which a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where is the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Catholique Church, and by that Church he will be directed about former tymes; he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res therefore D. Luther to tell him where the Catholique Church is now, for ſuch <hi>a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall one</hi> the Bible ſpeakes of. This queſtion muſt be anſwered; the man that doth aske it may be any that is in England, for example, and it might haue bene anſwered in Lurhers time who was your Maſter, for which reaſon I tie the queſtion to that tyme for the more perſpicuitie, and leaue the man with you to answer for your Maſter.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:344:65"/> age did leaue them to their poſteritie, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to their Children, the Maſters to their Schollers: Now thoſe of the ſeauenth age, as I haue noted more fullie in the former booke, Byſſhops, Paſtors, learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and generallie all the Church of that tyme, hauing theſe pregnant and infallible meanes of informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by writings, and otherwiſe, did iudge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and therevppon did engage their part in heauen and eternall eſtate, that they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their faith and Religion from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age being the ſixt: Wherefore ſince a world of men in matter of Facte, as whether their Fathers we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Maſſe, praied to Saincts &amp;c. could not be deceaued, the thing being ſubiect to the eie, and there being infinite eies obſeruing religiouſly what was donne, it followes cleerlie, ſince the world generally did then beleeue this to be the Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by their Fathers, that ſo it was.</p>
               <p n="18">18. My fourth argument shall be this. Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, as you terme it, was the generall Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world in the tyme of Boniface the third, as you may ſee in the Eccleſirſticall hiſtories of that tyme, whereby appeares, that all generally did goe to Maſſe, pray to Saincts confeſſe their ſinnes &amp;c. and your men allſo <label type="milestone">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:344:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> withall the world, and this Religion did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the communion of Nations till the tyme of S. Leo and S.

Gregory had bene imployed at Conſtantinople, came to be Pope, and died alſo within the ſpace of three yeares after; in which ſpace the Religion of the Chriſtian world was not generally chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as wee ſee manifeſtly by all hiſtories of that tyme, therefore the Religion which was vniuerſally in the world in Bonifacius his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was the ſame religion with that which was vniuerſally in the world in tyme of S. Gregorye which Religion you confeſſe to be the right. Moreouer, that in the foreſaid ſpace of three yeares it was not changed, beſides the Teſtimony which is taken out of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of that tyme, where no mention is made of ſuch a change, by friend or foe, but all things currant as before in matters of faith I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme firſt, by the practiſe of Sainct Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine and his companie, who being ſent by Pope Gregorie, brought Papiſtrie from him into England; as is largly obſerued in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants

Thirdly, it is not only incredible to any man of iudgment, but alſo manifeſtly vnpoſſible by reaſon of the diuine ordinance and promiſe of Ieſus Chriſt that all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people, in the ſpace of three yeares, without meeting in common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, without reſiſtance of any zealous men, without force of armes or other conſtraint, should generally change the religion of the whole world, and conſpire all generally (for you cannot produce any one man who ſtood for your Religion in that tyme, which you would haue vs beleeue was the Religion of the firſt ſix hundred yeares, there is not in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories mention of any one Proteſtant man then reſiſting, therefore I ſay againe, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they should conſpire all) all kingdomes, all ſtates, all Prouinces, all Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, all vniuerſities, all Byſshops, and generally all men liuing, learned and vnlearned, good and bad, Paſtors and people, againſt the Euidence of the former Religion, againſt the Religion

In all Nations and at all yeauen the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:344:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt obſcure tymes it hath beene a generall notion, a faith tranſcendent, a common and moſt conſtant Principle that there is a Deitie: ſoe fathers taught their children, ſo Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers did prooue in ſchooles, ſoe the worlds variety, and order, and beautie, and maieſtie did proclaime abroade. No man ſo ſimple but knowes he hath a cauſe: and (each being of the ſame nature) all the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> all mankinde hath a cauſe. Each ſubordinate cauſe hath a cauſe; and the collection of ſubordinate and depending cauſes doth argue the exiſtencie of a higher power ſupereminent vnto the collection, on which power they all depend: which efficient being none of the dependant cauſes, is whollie without a cauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath of it ſelf an infinite neceſſitie in Being and in all that appertaynes thereunto. Moreouer, becauſe infinite in exiſtencie and <hi>Being,</hi> all wiſdome, all power, all perfection is in it: and this immateriall, intellectuall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, omnipotent, all-commaundinge Creatour wee call God: who, as he doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeablie exceede all, ſo is he in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner incomprehenſible of all, and liues eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie in the height and fullnes of bliſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d enioying his owne ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which is the roote and fountaine of exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtencie, the originall and vniuerſall veritie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

But his ignorance is verie childish. Each man hath a cauſe as I ſaid, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore the whole nature or <hi>ſpecies</hi> hath a cauſe; for, if any had not, he weare not of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> or nature with the reſt, he weare not a pure man. The whole collection or multitude therefore of men, the verie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the <hi>ſpecies</hi> doth depend on ſome cauſe efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which likewiſe <hi>dependeth</hi> on an other, or is <hi>independent</hi> and immoueable: if <hi>independent</hi> and immoueable, it hath Being by it ſelf preciſelie, without any cauſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or contingencie what ſoeuer, and therefore hath a pure, vnlimited, and ſo an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite neceſſitie in Being, and this is God. If the cauſe of mankind hath <hi>a cauſe,</hi> and that an other, ſtill the collection of depending cauſes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:344:79" rendition="simple:additions"/> (whether finite, as it is indeede, or infinite as one might dreame) doth depende, and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially too, this being an attribute common to them all, therefore vppon a cauſe; for it is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish to ſay that an effect is dependent and not vppon a cauſe, or to make a circle in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſubordinate: there is therefore a cauſe which is none of the dependent cauſes, and vppon this the collection of dependant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doth depend, and this (beare with me for repeating oft the ſame words) becauſe it is none of the dependant cauſes is abſolutlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, and God. Braſſe, you knowe, doth not bring it ſelf to the forme of Mercurie or Caeſar; nor doth matter bring it ſelf to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of a lion, tree, or man: and generally, no potentiality can put it ſelf in <hi>acte,</hi> but hath it by the efficient: <hi>if</hi> therefore <hi>nothing had a pure,</hi> infinite, eternall, <hi>neceſsitie of Being,</hi> but that everie thinge were potentiall to this <hi>acte, nothing could bring it ſelf into Being, and ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be at all.</hi> Whereas notwithſtanding, you are, other things are, and therefore the contradictorie muſt be graunted, that is, <hi>ſome thing hath a pure neceſsitie in Being</hi> which giues Being to the reſt, and this is God.</p>
               <p n="31">31, Now though there weare in all Nations as I ſaid, this principle and ground of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is a Deitie, year in the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:344:80"/> of this generall ground in obſcure tymes there were many errours among men: as man is apt to conceaue euery thing limited (his owne nature being ſo) and limitation giues way to varietie: Whereas indeede that thing which is remote from potentialitie is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall, pure, infinite, and but <hi>one.</hi> Some, admitting a deitie or one thing beſt amongſt all, and erroneouſelie ſubſuming that the Sunne was the beſt thing, concluded in their errour, the Sunne was God. Others, the Moone, Starrs, Men, and ſuch like. Among the Gentiles there were diuers greate ſcholers; who with the power of ſtronger witts bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings thorough thoſe clouds of ignorance found out that he was one, immutable, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; as Ariſtotle, Plato, Triſmegiſtus: but he by ſpeciall fauour ſingularlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed himſelf vnto the Nation of the Iewes, and there was peculiarlie ſerued and adored.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Theſe Iewes had among them many Prophets which foretolde certainely future and contingent things as the euent after did did manifeſt.

Philoſophie hath beene labouring many thouſand yeeres, to vnite all vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the grounds of Nature, cleere in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and within the compaſſe of mans witte but with all her Schooles, she cannot effect her purpoſe: the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger she teacheth, the more men diſagree.

The Fisher-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing neuer heard Philoſophy ſpeake out of her pulpit, were to make the Schooles beleeue a darke obſcure Creede; being vnarmed, they were to meete the Sword.

Yet, vnlerned and vnarmed as they were; notwithſtanding the violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſenſualitie, Power, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Hell it ſelf, they haue brought their Creede a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diſcipline (Poſteritie being aſtonished at the euent) into Nations, into Courts, into the whole World: and ſo powerfully, that it hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vniuerſallie diffuſed theſe ſixteene hundred yeeres.

You haue ſeene the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, that is <hi>the congregation of Chriſtians in communion at all tymes with the See of Rome,</hi> by a Catholique man, I meane one who beleeues the Creede of this Church, <hi>one of this comunion:</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euerie one which did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore embrace this communion was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, ſo long as he did embrace it, and died a Catholique if he died in it. In the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with this Church, is included a <hi>Vnion</hi> with it: which vnion is founded in a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, or vniformitie of faith and iudgment in diuine matters. And this was in all thoſe who did reſolue their beleefe into the propoſition or iudgment of this Church. For, he who ſubmittes his iudgment whollie to the Church, and beleeues as she telles him readie
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:344:100"/> to beleeue more, if she declare her ſelfe more fullie, and to condemne all doctrine which she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnes, is vndiuided from the Church in iudgment, and therefore <hi>vniforme.</hi>

Hence it comes alſo that not onelie thoſe who liued at one tyme, were of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but ſuch alſo as liued in diuers ages: becauſe the following age did receaue the doctrine, and generall decrees of the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, beleeuing all which was then by the Church beleeued, and condemning ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions as they condemned.

               <p n="54">54, I had made a full point, and was going on to the next Chapter; but I remembred with whom I am now againe dealing, and that I am to repeate the ſame things ouer more then once, hauing for the ſame reaſon alſo contented my ſelfe with verie few things among infinite which might be ſaid for our cauſe. <hi>My chiefe intention</hi> therefore in this <hi>ſecond booke</hi> was, onelie to declare which companie of people in all the world, is the Church Catholique, or the Church anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Gods eternall decree declared by the Prophets.

That is, I take them to declare that the Church in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the See of Rome is and hath bene euer the Church deſcribed by the Prophets, and that no other anſwearable to that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription is any where els to be found. VVhen you anſweare this Booke, I will haue no other thing anſweared in this place but this.

                  <hi>THE SEVENTH CHAPTER.</hi> Wherin anſweare is giuen to ſome exceptions made againſt the Vniuerſalitie of the Church.</head>
               <p>THe Arguments which you and your abotters make againſt the foreſaid vniuerſality of the Church,<note place="margin">S. Aug. de Vnit. Eccl. c. 12.</note> are anſweared eaſily. And whereas, firſt as Donatiſts hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did allſo, you plead for your pouertie a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d paucitie of adherentes, that there are fewe chozen, and the world full of fooles: I confeſſe there are to many fooles indeede, and haue bene euer, if you conſider the whole collection of all kinde of Heretickes, together with Paganes, and Atheiſtes: the number whereof being infinite, the world may be ſaid to be full. But what is this to the purpoſe, ſince the Catholique Church not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſpreds it ſelfe into all Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d makes ſome of euery nation (and thoſe verie many alſo) wiſe, many being called by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, by the Apoſtles, by God to Chriſtianitie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which many though they receaue the word, and for a tyme doe well, doe flinch in tyme of temptation, and fall of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end, and ſo they be fooles too, and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:344:103"/> with the foolish virgines be shut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But yet notwithſtanding all this, there are in the Catholique Church ſome wiſe of all nations, tongues, and people, more then can be numbred, which infalliblie will gaine the crowne of glorie.</p>
               <p n="56">56. An other exception you make againſt our Church becauſe it doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with all Chriſtians, as with your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Whereunto I anſweare that to the Churches vniuerſalitie, communion with Heretickes, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Schiſmatiques is not neceſſarie, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with, or in all Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and this communion the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church with the reſt adherent hath. With Heretiques wee will not communicate, and doe herein follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our Sauiour, and Sainct Paule. And accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glie the Church in former tymes would not communicate with Arians, Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Neſtorians: or with Armenians, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Aethiopia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or others at ſuch tyme as they were in errour. Neither was this communion neceſſarie to the vniuerſalitie of the Church, as I ſaid before, becauſe it is not neceſſarie that it communicate with all perſones in the world, but with all Nations. Nor it is neceſſarie that the Churches communion, be at once in all nations, and ſo continue: but that in the compaſſe of her tyme it be in all. And thus is our Religion Catholique which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:344:104"/> hath bene in all Nations one tyme, or other, that hetherto haue bene Chriſtian, which can be truelie ſaid of noe other: and by her great power of conuerting Nations is going on to poſſeſſe the reſt of the Nations that are on earth.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Thirdly you except againſt the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſome Councelles, wheru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to the Greeke Church then deuided, would not come. But this is noe hindrance to the cauſe; for to the generalitie of a Councell, noe more can be required poſſiblie for perſones, them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and conſent of the Byſshopes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholique Church, ſince <hi>Catholique Paſtors,</hi> not <hi>heretiques,</hi> are to be heard, followed, and obaied in matters of faith and religion. Theſe doe ſucceed in the promiſe made to the Apoſtles, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the worldes end, and in them is the whole teaching authoritie of the Church-preſent vnto the tyme wherin they are, whether they be more or not ſo many as were ſome age before. In particular to that of the Grecians I anſweare that their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent was not neceſſarie to the generalitie of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles held in the tyme they liued in Schiſme and Hereſie, and therefore without them the Councell was Oecumenicall: for that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is Oecumenicall which doth include the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:344:104"/> authoritie of the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Catholique Church. It is not requiſite that all Biſshops which euer were, should be raiſed againe to life to ſitt in Councell, nor that ſuch as in after ages are to come, should be borne afore their tyme, to make a Councell generall: neither is it neceſſarie to call in Heretiques of all ſortes. It is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to call the Byſshopes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique communion then liuinge, when the Councell is to be held.</p>
               <p>The Grecians in the tyme of their Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, were not of your religion, as you haue heard from their owne mouthes, when you offered vnion: and in your owne iudgment they held hereſie, as that is of the proceſſion of the holie Ghoſt from the Father onelie. They returned alſo to the communion of the Catholique Church, as you may ſee in the Councell of Lions, and Florence, where Eaſt and weſt agreed in doctrine againſt your he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie: and before their Schiſme they had bene in the communion of the Church a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares wel neere. Of Indians and Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians you know by this what I will ſaie, and it is not neceſſarie to runne ouer the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p n="57">57. A fourth exception is, that all nations be not at one time in the Church becauſe ſome are Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome Hereticke. And hence would
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:344:105"/> you make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue a ſcruple in reciting that part of his Creed wherin he doth profeſſe to beleeue the Catholique Church then exiſtent when he ſaies his Creede. Notwithſtanding this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Creed was ſaid in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tyme, by ſuch as were in their viſible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and muſt, and will be ſaid as long as the world endures: and he that ſaieth it, if he beleeues Gods word and promiſe, may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d muſt beleeue that ſtill there is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, which Church hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: though this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all the latitude be not exiſtent at that tyme, but ſome was before, ſome is to follow after: as the Church it ſelfe taken whollie, is not exiſtent all at one tyme, but ſucceſſiuelie to the worldes end, it being the collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all Catholiques which euer were, are, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d will be.</p>

                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:344:105"/> of Ariminium (neuer approued by the See Apoſtolike, nor euer acknowledged for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by the Church, and by your ſelues alſo reiected) I anſweare that there was noe cauſe of feare that the Church should by that acte be all deceaued and erre in faith; for the Church hath alwayes the aſſiſtance of the holie Ghoſt, to preſerue her from errour in faith, by couenant of God the Father, and promiſe of God the ſonne, as in the next bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oke you shall heare at large. Neither wanted there at any tyme learned men who knew that a Councell wanting the conſent of the See Apoſtolique was not Oecumenical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, nor an infallible rule of faith.</p>
               <p n="58">58. If you plead againſt the viſibilitie of our Church with this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; it is weake, for the Arians euer found oppone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and thoſe viſible, ſuch as at laſt wonne the field. If you plead with it againſt the vniuerſalitie of the Church it is alſo weake: and impertinent. it is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as it comes from you, becauſe thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians were not Proteſtantes, and therfore their number makes nothing for the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie of your cauſe. And it is alſo weake; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their communion was neuer with all Nations, nor did euer equall the vniuerſalitie of the Church. Which is euident, becauſe the Catholique communion was elder by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:344:106"/> three hunderd yeares and was in that tyme ſpred ouer all Chriſtendome, and hath continued after Arianiſme is gone theſe many hundred yeeres in the communion of the Chriſtian world; and more Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue bene ſince conuerted to it, and are dailie, and ſo will be till she hath bene in the communion of them all. If therfore you will meaſure both, take each communion in her greateſt latitude of tyme and place or Nations; and you will preſentlie ſee Arianiſme to be too narrowe and too short: as not hauing poſſeſſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations, nor dured ſo longe a tyme. Much leſſe will you find, that, begining the ſame tyme, it ranne ſide by ſide in an equall or a fuller ſtreame through all ages to this daie and were ſo to continue: if you intended this I should ſuſpect your braine.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Touching the compariſon of it to that part of the Church at leaſt which was at that tyme; you thinke it ſo filled all places of the Chriſtian world that Catholiques had noe roome. This errour is of ignorance, you may amend it if you inquire of ſome who did liue then. If I should bring many teſtimonies, you would ſaie I were tedious in matter of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and therfore will content my ſelfe, and you alſo if you be reaſonable, with one from many Authors. S. Athanaſius a man beyond
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:344:106"/> exception, together with diuers Byſshopes of Aegypt, Thebais and Libia, wrote to Iouia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour, of the Nicene faith thus: <hi>Know certainely,</hi>

                  <hi>moſt holie Emperour that this ſame faith hath bene published from all memorie of ages: this the holie fathers aſſembled at Nice haue confirmed, to this haue aſſented all Churches euerie where, as of Spaine, of Britanie, of France, of all Italie, of Dalmatia, of Myſia, of Macedonia, and all Greece, and all the Churches of Africke, Sardinia, Cyprus, Creete, Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>philia, Lycia, Iſauria, and the Churches of Aegypt, Lybia, Pontus, Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, and the Churches of the bordering countryes, and finallie the Churches of the east ſome fewe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted which doe fauour the Arian ſect; for wee doe certainelie know the ſentence of them all, and haue receaued letters from them, and doe know certainlie moſt holie Emperour, that although a fewe doe contradict this faith, the whole world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer preiudice therby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="60">60. Sixtly you oppoſe vnto vs want of vnitie. I anſweare that all Catholiques doe ſubmit their vnderſtandings to the iugment of the Church and to the generall decrees of their Paſtores, and maſters, readie to beleeue whatſoeuer they generallie in Councells doe define, and to reiect whatſoeuer they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne; and by theſe meanes are vnited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie vnto thoſe Councelles, and to the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:344:107"/> whole Church in faith and iudgment about religion: each man in the Church hauing his vnderſtanding vndeuided in beleefe from the Church, and ſo being one with it: Vnitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting <hi>in Indiuiſion</hi> as you haue learned of the philoſopher lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge agoe. Our Councelles like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are one in doctrine, as the partes of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are (though they be not Scripture, but declarations of Gods word) that is they are vndiuided: there being amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all noe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or diſſent in decrees and definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the later receauing what hath bene formerlie defined, wherof hereafter I will diſcourſe a part, becauſe as Iulian, Porphyrie and others thought they ſawe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ſo you haue imagined the like of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles, though nothing ſo many, nor haueing that shew, as thoſe had which by the foreſaid infidelles were obiected; and if you know not ſo much, you are not of that reading your frindes haue taken you to be. To your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente I ſaie therfore that this companie hath vnitie in beleefe: noe man at all in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie being diuided from the reſt in beleefe, howſoeuer about thinges vndefinied and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by the Church in their tyme there might be diuerſitie of opinions a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may be now in the like, as he knowes that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:344:107"/> hath bene a weeke in the Schooles of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie. The ſame companie hath original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie likewiſe vnitie in religion, and faith, each vnderſtanding in the whole myſticall bodie, being ſubmitted to the ſame iudge of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies, that is to Gods Spiritte in the Church Catholique; and acknowledging this one Spiritte and this one Church, and this one Spiritte in this one Church iudging, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, determining, ruling all. VVhich common vnion and conſent in one, makes their communion, ſo generall, ſo firme, and ſo conſpicuous as you are faine to ſee with your eies againſt your will.</p>
               <p n="61">61. A ſeuenth argument is made againſt ſucceſſion, and it is obiected that wee haue noe ſucceſſion of Catholiques, or of ſuch as wee are. I anſweare, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique religion and Church is that whoſe communion is with all Nations, as you haue heard: and a Catholicke is a man who doth reſolue his faith into this Church, and into the Spiritte which doth aſsiſt and teach it; ſuch were all who did receaue the Generall Councelles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoken of, and the doctrine of the Church preſent to the tymes wherein
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:344:108"/> they liued, which were infinite, and ſuch will be to the worldes end. If you will haue ſome aſſigned more particularly that you may diſpute againſt them, I name whole aſſemblies of paſtors in Generall Councell. I name the Generall Councells mentioned heretofore. In them was our Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and the Catholique Church in them was conſpicuous, and worlds of people did communicate with them. This is a ſucceſſion becauſe they were not all at one tyme; and a Catholique ſucceſſion, becauſe the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Nations was with them: and with their faith and their Decrees.</p>
               <p n="61">61. Other obiections you haue againſt the truth of the doctrine which this Church doth maintaine: But the chiefeſt of them are allready anſweared in another place: And hereafter I will proue at large that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church onelie hath the aſſiſtance of the all teaching Spiritte, and therfore cannot be condemned of errour by any meanes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the world whatſoeuer: noe iudgment being of greater or of equall authoritie with hers, by reaſon of the Spiritte which doth teach her all truth.</p>

                  </gap>opoſition of diuine faith. This aſsiſtance in Church-propoſition wee beleeue, and that you muſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:344:109"/> alſo grant, and beleeue it, I am now to prooue. You will not denie that men are to be inſtructed trulie, in faith an diuine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for how shall they liue as Chriſtians ought, vnles they beleeue rightlie, and how shall they beleeue rightlie, if they be not well taught and inſtructed? <hi>how shall they inuocate</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in whome they haue not beleeued?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and how shall they beleeue in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue not heard, or how shall they heare without a preacher?</hi> it cannot be. For no man of himſelfe is able to finde out, or to diſcouer the myſteries of our faith; the Trinitie; the Incarnation of the Sonne of God; the Scriptures, and their meaning. It is therefore neceſſarie that men be inſtructed in matters of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſince inſtruction is neceſſarie (as wee alſo by experience know) this inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt be looked for in ſome Schoole and from ſome maſters or inſtructors. The queſtion therefore comes preſentlie about this teaching Schoole, which and where it is, that a man there may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. To this queſtion the anſweare is eaſie: <hi>first</hi> it is not the companie of Athieſts or Pagans, for their doctrine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is not holie and diuine. <hi>Secondlie</hi> it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:344:110"/> not the companie of Iewes, for their doctrine is not Chriſtian. <hi>Thirdlie</hi> it is not the companie of confeſſed Heretiques; therefore <hi>it is the Church,</hi> for the Church is the Schoole of Ieſus Chriſt: and which this is, I haue declared in the former booke. This ſuppoſed I reaſon thus for diuine aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It belongs to the prouidence of allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God to aſſiſt that Schoole in which by his will and ordinance the whole world is to be inſtructed in diuine matters and Religion: Therefore it belongs to Gods prouidence to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> aſſiſt the Church, for the Church is the ſaid Schoole, as I declared before. The argument is cleere and needs no further confirmation. but leaſt you ſeeke to eſcape it (if it be vrged by one that is no Scholler) with ſome fonde diſtinction, I note here that the Spirit doth aſſiſt to <hi>beleeue</hi> and <hi>to teach.</hi> The firſt of theſe acts is in the vnderſtanding, and interior: the ſecond is publique or exterior, and in the mouth. The Spirit doth aſſiſt the Church both wayes, that is to beleeue, and to teach: but the argument doth proceede here of aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the later, <hi>to teach:</hi> becauſe faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to S. Paul doth ſuppoſe inſtruction or teaching: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d euery one should haue faith, for <hi>without faith</hi> it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:344:110"/> 
                  <hi>he that beleeueth not shall be condemned.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. Mar. 16.</note> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer you knowe that for reſolution in diuine matters, it is neceſſarie that a man knowe where to ſeeke inſtruction, whom he may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curelie followe, in whoſe iudgment he may reſt, in whome and where the Spirit of God doth ſpeake. This is the thinge wee looke for, and this thing is in noe other companie but the Schoole of Ieſus Chriſte the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It may be you will ſay that a man deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of inſtruction should come to you. But this will not ſatisfie, for what should a man haue done before Luther, when Proteſtants were not, nor your Religion thought vppon as I haue ſeene allreadie in the firſt booke. He might haue gone ouer all the world to looke for your Church and loſt his labour. But deale plainlie with vs and declare your minde, is there any congregation in the world whoſe inſtruction one may ſecurelie fellowe, or no? if there be not, what courſe should vnlearned men take to learne the truth? shall they beleeue without preachers? If there be which is it, and whence hath it that it may be followed? of it ſelfe? or from the Spirit? you can anſweare nothinge, but the Spirit: and this Spirit, not in Athieſts, nor in Iewes, nor in confeſſed Heretiques,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:344:111"/> but in the Church. And thus much for thoſe who ſeeke inſtruction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I prooue <hi>ſecondlie</hi> this aſſiſtance by the neceſsitie of a Iudge to determine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> in matter of Religion. Since the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is obſcure in many places, and ſince Hereſies do and muſt ariſe in the world, it is neceſſarie that there be ſome Viſible meanes able and ſufficient to determine controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which meanes can be no other, but the propoſition and iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church. For, being viſible, and intelligent, able to heare, examine and define the controuerſies, it muſt needs conſiſt of men, not of meere Spirits, or of inſenſible creatures: and if it conſiſt of men theſe men muſt not be Athieſts, or enemies to the Chriſtian doctrine, ſuch as are Pagans, Iewes, and confeſſed Heretiques, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore they muſt be the Church, <hi>or that part of it which is to teach.</hi> The iudge of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies therefore is the Church. Whence it followes that the holie Spirit doth aſsiſt her in this act of determining controuerſies in matter of faith, directing her vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue the meaning of Gods word, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing her from errour in the propoſition of it. This diſcourſe you cannot denie with any shewe of probabilitie, for there is no meanes to make an end of controuerſies among men,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:344:111"/> if the iudgment of the Church be neglected, or be not certaine a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d infallible: if the Spirit of truth be not in the Church it is in none at all; if it doth not teach the Church, it doth teach none; if it doth not direct the Church to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Gods word, it directeth none; if it doth not aſſiſt the Church when she for the generall good of the Chriſtian world doth determine a controuerſie of faith, it doth aſsiſt none at all: for all the promiſe made by our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt of aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is made vnto the Church, and the onelie meanes which men haue vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be informed of the truth is by recourſe vnto it, vnto the Church, and to the Spiritte in her.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I will deſcend vnto particulars, and make it more manifeſt. A man beleeuing or knowing that there is a God, would gladlie heare what he hath imparted to men of the truth, and therfore inquires for Gods word, he would eſteeme himſelfe happie if he could be certainlie directed to it, and not cozened with other things in ſteed of it, with forged Goſpells and Epiſtles: To this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church doth giue ſatisfaction by reaching him the Bible and aſſuring him that she knowes it to be Gods word, by the aſſiſtance and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the diuine Spiritte, which protectes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:344:112"/> her from errour in beleefe: and this promiſe she had from Ieſus Chriſt, who by miracles, by prophecies, and other ſufficient meanes prooued himſelfe to be the Sonne of God. You on the otherſide, who denie this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and aſsiſtance, can giue him no ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world. Next opening this booke he finds it hard, as containing many obſcure paſſages about the Trinitie, the Incarnation, the death of Chriſt, his reſurrection, the ſacrament of his bodie and blood &amp;c. to this the Church anſwears him directlie, and tells him the ſenſe of God, aſſuring him as before, that she by the aſsiſtance of the diuine Spiritte left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her doth know is to be ſo. You leaue him without ſatisfaction, to the dishonour of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whoſe wiſedome you call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion withall, whilſt you denie, that he proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded meanes for men to be informed of his doctrine, and of the waie to ſerue God.</p>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:344:114"/> yet, as that without the iudgment of Gods Spiritte in the Church men cannot be certaine which is Gods word, and what is the ſenſe: and therfore you muſt yeeld at laſt that the Church is aſſiſted in propoſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine things by the Spiritte of Allmightie God.</p>
               <p n="11">11.<note place="margin">c. 1.</note> A fourth argument I make out of the promiſes of perpetuitie made vnto the Church, and related in the former booke. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie <label type="milestone">

Since therfore it is cleere by the teſtimonie of God himſelfe, that the Church cannot faile, it is certaine allſo, that is cannot fall from faith, and therfore that Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth perpetuallie aſſiſt it to the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the faith. You anſweare that the whole Church may fall from Charitie and from the loue of God, and therfore from faith allſo. This would not follow in termes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe loue doth ſuppoſe faith, and therfore (if God had not otherwiſe ordained) might be gone and leaue it behind, as it doth oft in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. And peraduenture your ſelfe do not loue euerie one you knowe, or if you do, euerie bodie doth not ſo: wherfore loue and

               <p n="12">12. The fift way to prooue the ſaid aſſiſtance is the continuall preſence of our Sauiour, and thus the diſcourſe is made. If the Apoſtles
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:344:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> and their ſucceſſors haue the aſſiſtance of our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>5</label> Sauiour to the preaching of the Goſpell and miniſtring of the Sacraments continuallie till the worlds end, then hath the Church diuine aſſiſtance, ſince the Apoſtles and their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors be the Church, and our Sauiour God. But the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors haue this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of our Sauiour, as the words of the Goſpell do prooue and manifeſt, where our Sauiour to his diſciples ſaid.<note place="margin">Matth. 28 18.19.20.</note> 
                  <hi>All power is giuen to me in heauen and in earth, going therfore teach yee all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the ſonne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the holie Ghoſt, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them to obſerue all things whatſoeuer I haue commaunded you, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d behold I am with you all daies euen to the conſummation of the world.</hi> You know that a coexiſtence of two things to the end of the world, includes the exiſtence of each of them all that tyme. I was not with you all the yeere, becauſe I came awaie before it was halfe donne. Since therfore the Apoſtles had not exiſtence here on earth all the dayes till the worlds e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which is not yet come though they be dead and gone many hundred yeares agoe, it followes that our Sauiour ſpeakes allſo in them to their ſucceſſors, and conſequently to the Church in all ages whilſt the world doth endure. And by this meanes I haue what I deſire in this place that I neede looke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p n="13">13. Out of the former comes another which is grounded in the obligation Chriſtians haue to heare their paſtors, and to beleeue their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and it shall be the ſixt which I will make thus. If all the people in the world be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>6</label> obliged vnder paine of eternall damnation to beleeue the doctrine which the Church, that is, the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors do teach, it belongs to the goodnes and prouidence of God thus obliging them to haue a care that it be right a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d true, otherwiſe he would oblige them to erre and liue amiſſe, which is againſt the goodnes and therfore againſt the nature of allmightie God. But it is true that all the people in the world are thus obliged as I prooue by the words of our Sauiour in ſainct Marke. <hi>Going into the world preach the Goſpell to all creatures,</hi>

                  <hi>he that beleeueth and is baptized shall be ſaued: but he that beleeueth not shall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Out of this argument followeth yet further, that the Church cannot erre in any thing of faith, whether it be <hi>fundamentall,</hi> or <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> incurable, or curable, great or little: for the people are to beleeue that which the Church doth teach, and thus God doth warrant in the place here alleaged, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p n="14">14. The ſeauenth argument I make out of the iudgment of all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s before Luther touching the foreſaid obligation to beleeue the Church, and the diuine ſpirit in it. And here I except onelie ſuch as your ſelfe shall confeſſe to haue bene Heretiques, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede thus. Generall Councells did allwayes <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>7</label> beleeue that the Church was to be beleeued, and that it had diuine aſſiſtance, and therfore did accurſe all thoſe who beleeued the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Church. This you know by their acts, and canons. The people in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with theſe Councells did beleeue the ſame which the Councells did, and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that which they defined. The fathers, Saint Auguſtine, Saint Hierome and the reſt did the ſame. And the ſame did all the predeſtinate who liued in the communion of the Church, takinge their inſtruction from the mouth of the Church, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as the Church did. which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt becauſe thoſe are damned who beleeued not the Church, as hath bene proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the former argument out of Sauiours words: ſince therfore the predeſtinate are
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:344:117"/> ſaued, it remaines vndeniable that they did beleeue the Church.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And here becauſe you ſome tymes when you haue dronke to much of the cuppe of ſelfe loue, do thinke that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the holie Ghoſt better then any of our religion haue done, eſpeciallie ſince you laſt were in heauen, and read your name there in the booke of life, I oppoſe ſpiritte vnto ſpiritte, I oppoſe vnto you the knowne Saints of our Religion both late and ancient, and obiect vnto you the Spiritte which was in them.

Among the auncient you haue the holie fathers and Martyres; it were longe to repeate their names here, You haue the martyrologe of Baronius, there are thouſands of them, and the places where they liued; conſult his notes thereunto, if you doubt of any. And now I argue thus. All true Chriſtians in all ages euen from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tyme did euer reſt in the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church as infallible: beleeui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g what was in the Church before them vniuerſallie beleeued, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

This anſweare doth change the ſenſe of all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, for it addeth the condition of following the Scripture, wheras the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and couenant of allmightie God is <hi>abſolute</hi> and without condition as were the reſt of the promiſes of ſending a Meſsias, and calling the Gentiles, and the promiſe our Sauiour made of ſending the holie Ghoſt after his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion.

               <p n="33">33 I muſt tell you moreouer, firſt that God with a fewe words can ſignifie many things, his comprehenſion being infinite and he knowing all the ſignifications and vſes of all words. And next, that I take theſe words of Ieſus Chriſt in the whole fullnes of their ſenſe and meaning, though ſome Interpreters haue contented themſelues to put a part of it onelie downe, hauing not then occaſion as wee haue now to ſearth further. In the Church are people and Paſtors, the Spiritte aſsiſts all, ſome to teach a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to gouerne, others to obaie and to be directed. Some are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with theſe the ſpiritte continues to perſeuerance, ſome are not but for a tyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and this by the aſſiſtance of the ſpiritte
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:344:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> And ſome of them are teachers allſo and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this kinde do participate allſo the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, who diſpoſeth all as he pleaſeth, diuiding his guifts a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d graces among men, to his glorie and the good of the predeſtinate. In fine all thoſe whoſe names are written in the booke of life perſeuere finallie. So that the Spirit leades them further to the ſtate of glorie, and there shewes them all truth in it ſelfe, abiding ſo with them for all eternitie.</p>
               <p n="34">34. But now let vs heare what you ſaie to this place. Firſt you ſaie it is promiſed to the Apoſtles, in their owne perſons onelie. This is falſe, firſt becauſe it is promiſed to remaine with them <hi>for euer,</hi> whereas the Apoſtles in their owne perſons were not to liue euer heere: and perpetuall coexiſtence of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames includes a perpetuall exiſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of each of them as I noted before vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it is to them therfore and to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors after them without ending at any tyme and ſo foreuer. Secondlie by the end of the graunt the ſame is euident: for the Church now a daies ſtands in neede of this Aſsiſtance as well as it did then and in ſome reſpects more; becauſe it is greater: and the like it is of other ages, and will be ſtill to the worlds end: ſince therefore the prouidence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:344:128"/> for the eſtablishment of his Church and ſaluation of his elect is perfect, the graunt holds according to the letter, and is ſo to be vnderſtood as the word ſtands, <hi>foreuer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35. Next you ſaye the ſence is, the Spiritte teacheth the Church all the truth that is taught her. If I should tell you that my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in England did teach me all languages, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe afterwards they were but two that he taught me, you would thinke ſure that I did lie, for two be not all. Yet would you haue the Scripture to ſpeake in this manner. But I anſweare that the words of Scripture are plaine, <hi>he shall teach all whatſoeuer I shall ſay to you: whatſoeuer he shall heare: all truth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ch. 14. v. 26 Ch. 16. v. 13</note> And I thinke if I should giue you all my bookes, you would not be contented if my executors should giue you the tenth part, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the will, I giue you all, that is, all which are giuen you: and then define what that is, among themſelues, as you doe in the matter of fundamentall points; but of this hereafter.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The third waie of eluding the place is to ſaie that in heauen the Spirit teacheth all truth but not here. That in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he teacheth all I knowe well; but you erre againſt the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in denying that he teacheth all truth heere. Reade the text and you shall see that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:344:129"/> our Sauiour ſendeth the Spirit vnto the <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church</hi> from which he meant to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe his viſible preſence: to the Apoſtles left in the world: and to their Succeſſors, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in his abſence; to reduce vnto their minde what he had ſaid, and to aſsiſt and teach them all truth. <hi>The Spiritte of truth</hi> (ſaith excellentlie S.

                  <note place="margin">Cyrill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex. li. 10. in Ioan. cap. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>for he knoweth exactlie the truth whoſe ſpirit he is, and hath reuealed it vnto vs, not in part onelie, but entirely, for though in this life wee know in part onelie as S. Paul ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>not an imperfect but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire truth hath shined vnto vs in this litle know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The Obiects of the Churches faith, as the Trinitie, the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp;c. may be knowne either <hi>obſcurely</hi> by faith: or <hi>cleerely</hi> by viſion. The former of theſe is an vnperfect knowledge of them; the latter is perfect (As he that beleeues all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions in Euclide, for the Authoritie of Schollers who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agree in them knowes them vnperfectly: but he that can demonſtrate them knowes them perfectly) To both the foreſaid knowledges the holy Ghoſt doth leade the Church; to the <hi>former</hi> heere on earth; to the <hi>later</hi> in heauen. Of the one S. Cyrill heere doth ſpeake; of the other S. Auguſt. tract. 96. in Ioan. To helpe the ruder to the vnderſtanding of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the knowledge of the <hi>ſame things:</hi> Suppoſe a man were borne and bred in a caue vnder grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and there taught that aboue there be heauens, ſunne and ſtarrs: And afterwards brought out in a cleere night to behold the beautie of the firmament with the heauens immenſitie; In the day to ſee the Sunne illuſtrating all the world with his light. This later knowledge of theſe things is cleere and perfect if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the former which he before, at his being vnder ground where he ſaw no greater light then a poore candle, had of them. So is the Churches knowledge heere. Heere belowe, she is inſtruſted that in God there are three perſons, the Father the Sonne and the Holy Ghoſt, and makes an vnperfect obſcure conceipt of it: but when she getts vp thither she shall behold God cleerely as he is in himſelf. And ſo all the reſt of the Myſteries which now she doth beleeue.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. The fourth waie is to ſaie that the place is to be limited to thoſe truthes which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people. But this holds not, for what shall become of the learned? who shall compound differences in religion? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Hereſies: and repaire the faults of Schiſme, which teare the Church in peeces? if the Spirits aſsiſtance doth it not. In vaine doe you limit the words of God, you are a man, you are not God, you cannot rule him, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pare of what you pleaſe from his promiſe: his words import <hi>all,</hi> not onelie whatſoeuer; is neceſſarie for common people, but <hi>all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he hath reuealed:</hi> they are extended as farre as the neceſsities of the Church do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:344:129"/> Againe it is one thing to determine how far this aſſiſtance is affoorded to this, or that Chriſtian in particular which liues in a Catholique countrie and in peace, another thing it is to define how farre it is affoorded vnto the whole bodie of the Church.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The laſt waie is to ſaie that this promiſe was to be performed onelie in the inuiſible Church, by teaching them priuatelie. This is falſe. For the Church whereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to this promiſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:344:130"/> was made, was the viſible Church, and God made it to no other. The Apoſtles were viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And how could it be otherwiſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their noiſe went ouer all the world? The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Chriſtians in communion with them were viſible. Their Succeſſors, the Paſtors of the Church, were viſible. Their office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, of miniſtring the Sacramentes, and gouerning Gods people, did manifeſt their perſons to the flocke. The guifte of tongues, of interpretation, of working miracles and the like, made the men, and ſo the Church, viſible.

               <p n="44">44. THat you may haue ſome thing to ſay and conceale your vnſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie from ſuch as are not Schollers you put in here a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of fundamentall and not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points, and thinke to ſtoppe our mouthes with one peece of the diſtinction. Some of your fellowes expreſſe themſelues in other termes, but in ſenſe you meete. Your anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are is that the Church hath infallible aſsiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to fundamentall points, not to others. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fundamentall points you are not yet agreed, moſt commonly you thinke that they are the chiefe poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in the three Creeds, And agree all that they are very fewe. Some will haue fower, others ſix, others eight: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with the moſt that they be twelue. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your diſtinction the Spirit doth aſſiſt the Church infalliblie to theſe points and hath done ſo euer, It remaines now that I adde a word or two touching the reſt.</p>
               <p n="45">45. I am therefore to proue a further aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:344:134"/> of the Spiritte then to ſixe or twelue pointes which you call fundamentall; and firſt my Argumentes which I made in the former Chapters are not anſweared by your diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but proue ſtronglie that Gods aſſiſtance is to <hi>all;</hi> and your anſweare which makes a wide exception, whereas the Scripture hath none at all, is <hi>first</hi> without grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: You should haue showne your diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction there if you had expected beleefe, for men may not preſume to make exceptions at their pleaſure in the generall rule of God. <hi>Secondlie</hi> it leaues the world without ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the matter of controuerſies: for you leaue noe meanes at all to make an end of the For example; to end the controuerſies <hi>betwixt vs and you,</hi> you leaue noe meanes at all. <hi>Not the aſsiſtance</hi> of Gods Spiritte, for you ſaie they are in matters not fundamentall; and that our Church in fundamentalls neuer erred. <hi>Nor the witte</hi> of man, for all men if not aſſiſted, may erre in diuine matters. <hi>Nor the testimonie</hi> and iudgment of Antiquitie, for if they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of theſe matters it was either by their owne Wittes, and theſe without Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might erre: or it was by the aſſiſtance of the Spiritte to theſe pointes; which is agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the doctrine of your diſtinction. Nor is there any other, way found either in the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:344:134"/> of Gods Prouidence, (for this is the thing would ouerthrowe your diſtinction) or in the witte of man.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Thirdlie this doctrine of yours is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perfection of our Sauiours proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for all powerfull and wiſe perſons eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablishing a perpetuall common wealth, take order for the peace and vnitie of it, ſince diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the ruine of the publique weale: And our Sauiour as you haue heard before, hath inſtituted a ſpirituall common wealth to laſt foreuer, wherefore if he hath not ordained meanes for the peace and vnitie of it his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence hath ben deficient, and this commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth of his with infinite diuiſions ariſing about the moſt obſcure rule or lawe which he hath left will be torne into peeces and ſo perish, and not be perpetuall as he intended it should be. Againe, diuiſions and Schiſmes are not onelie in points, by you eſteemed funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, as appeareth cleerelie by your ſchiſme, And, Gods rule or written word containes not only things fundamentall in that ſenſe; as you may ſee in the Scripture wherein are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points of doctrine and manners all moſt infinite. And further yet; there is and hath ben controuerſie about the <hi>rule</hi> it ſelf; as <hi>which it is, how much</hi> is Scripture; <hi>which booke, which chapter, which verſe is or is not holy Scripture;</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:344:135"/> what is <hi>the meaning</hi> of this or that verſe which controuerſies muſt be decided, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there will neuer be vnitie and conſent about the diuine Word, rule and lawe. Now theſe things cannot be determined without Diuine Aſſiſtance as I argued before; and, for the Vnitie in Religion, and the Communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Perpetuitie, power to determine them is neceſſarie, wherefore, ſince our Sauiours Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence was not deficient, it followes that there is, and in the Church, ſuch power and Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Fourthlie if the holie miniſterie in the Church of God be eſtablished as a rule of mens faith to the end they be not in their faith <hi>wauering and borne about with euery winde of newe doctrine to the circumuention of errour,</hi> then is it by Gods aſsiſtance and perpetuall watch and direction infallible; but the ſacred miniſterie of the Church of God is thus eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Ieſus Chriſt, which I proue by the teſtimonie of S.

               <p n="68">68. By this diſtinction of <hi>vnfoulded</hi> and <hi>infoulded</hi> faith you now know my meaning, and it is this; That the faith of all Catholikes

And thus a man who reades the Scripture and ſtill doth increaſe in diuine knowledge, learning dailie more and more, is of the ſame religion and the ſame faith all the while. Thus are the people a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the ſame religion though the paſtors knowe and beleeue more in particular then the clownes euer heard of.

               <p n="70">70. You thinke peraduenture that no two are exactlie of the ſame religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnles their faith be equallie diſtinct in obiect, and vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded equallie; which conceipt if it were true, none were of the ſame religion with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their tyme, nor with the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in theirs, who beleeued not diſtinctlie and in particular, as many points as they did: which is a groſſe errour in Chriſtianitie, and makes as many religions allmoſt as men. Are you in your parish all of one religion or not? if you are, then by your rule (who cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide implicite faith) each old wife and yonge girle knowes as much in particular in the Bible and Deuinitie as your ſelfe; or if
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:344:144"/> they doe not, <hi>I</hi> praie you tell me how they be exactlie of the ſame religion with you? I knowe you will runne to fundamentalls, but the shift will not ſerue, becauſe agreement in fundamentalls in your ſenſe doth not ſuffize to the exact agreement in religion, for wee and you be not of one religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as all the world knowes, and yet <hi>you ſaie</hi> that wee diſagree not in fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talls; and indeede there are infinite waies to erre againſt Faith: otherwiſe he that did obſtinatelie denie all the Bible, and euerie verſe of it, excepting thoſe onelie wherin is one of your fundamentalls (which fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls as you recon them are verie fewe, and contained in the Creede with baptiſme and the ſupper) he I ſaie who did obſtinatelie this, were no Heretique but a man of your religion exactlie: howſoeuer he be deteſted by the Chriſtian world.</p>
               <p n="71">71. Hauing declared the reaſon whie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques are all of one religion, by reaſon of their common vnion in one vniuerſall principle containing their particular conſent in the reſt as occaſion doth require; to which generall principle they are all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the words and promiſe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: it is not amiſſe now to looke about for the originall cauſe why He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:344:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> are not all of one religion, ſince they reſolue all, or pretend to reſolue their faith into the Scripture, or the Spirit. I neede not goe farre to finde it out; for it is knowne by the definition of an Heretique. He is a man who makes his owne election by his priuate iudgment in matter of religion. And thence it is that hauing caſt of Church authoritie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d putt his owne witt in place to iudge, each takes where and what he likes: and their iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gments being diuers they take diuers things and expound diuerſlie.</p>
               <p n="74">74. Neither doth the ſcripture ſerue the turne in this caſe; <hi>firſt</hi> becauſe there is diſagreement which is Scripture: which cauſe muſt, be firſt determined by ſome iudge, and this iudge to each Heretick is his owne witt. <hi>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlie</hi> it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore there is infinite varietie in gueſſing at the meaning of it, as wee ſee by the experience of many hundred yeares, and in this caſe likewiſe each Heretique doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore his owne iudgment. As for the ſpirit, that of God is not among Heretiques: but in the Church, as I haue prooued: ſince therfore they are not the Church, and their Spirit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, it followes that it is another, and that erroneous. And by the mulplicitie of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and contradictions among them ſelues
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:344:145"/> it appeares euidentlie that they are many: and no meruaile, ſince each crowcheth vnto his owne; ſince each hath his Maozim within himſelfe. This therfore is the reaſon whie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Neſtorians, Lutherans &amp;c. though they be all againſt the Catholique, be not of one religion among them ſelues.</p>
               <p n="73">73. Neither would the conſequence be good if you should argue thus. Luther rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aues the letter of Scripture, and Caluin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaues the letter of Scripture, therefore Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Caluin are of one Religion: it doth not hold I ſay, ſince they receaue not <hi>the ſame ſenſe,</hi> nor are vnited, <hi>in any one common meane to receaue it.</hi> And were the argument good it would prooue Caluiniſts and Arians to be of the ſame Religion, ſince each receaue the letter.</p>
               <p n="74">74. Hence it comes allſo that all Heretiques cannot haue one definition, but that euery one is to be defined according to the points he doth hold in particular; becauſe of his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from others in the ſenſe, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he admitte the letter with others. And in taking this ſenſe he is not bounded by any authoritie common to him and to other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, but onelie by his owne <hi>will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</hi> Since therefore there is difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge Heretiques, and that this difference is
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:344:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> not by meanes of the letter,<note place="margin">Reflect well on all this when you anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the firſt booke.</note> nor of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good Spiritt (for that would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it ſelfe, as they do each other) this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference cannot be taken but from the ſenſe, imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d will of each partie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each partie muſt be defined by <hi>his owne wit,</hi> or by <hi>all his opinions in matter of faith.</hi>

               <p n="75">75. And here I anſweare to your common replie of the Schoolemens diſagreement in Schoole-queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; for (notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in matters not defined by the Church before or in their tyme) all Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that were Catholiques did agree in faith; and all did beleeue the ſame, according as I haue ſaid before of other men.

               <p n="82">82. THe obiections which you and your fellowes make are partlie againſt the infallibilitie of the Catholique Church in it ſelfe, and partlie againſt the infallibilitie of generall Councells, where Biſshops are aſſembled out of all Countries to determine commonlie by diuine aſſiſtance what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to faith, and what is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie therevnto. Of this ſecond part, it being not the whole Church <hi>formallie</hi> in it ſelfe (whereof I haue intreated hetherto,) but the whole in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation</hi> onelie, as deuines tearme it, I will ſpeake a word or two hereafter, And will anſweare that heere, which you bring againſt the firſt, which is the matter wee haue in hand. You are to shewe, not that ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man or ſome part of the Church might fall of, and leaue to be part of the Catholique not-erring Church, for that wee ſee cleerelie in your maſters Luther, Caluin, and others which once were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the Church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which was
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:344:152"/> in the communion of the Church for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres together, and by that communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catholique, as being then part of Gods Church. And is now fallen into ſchiſme and Hereſie: but you muſt proue that <hi>the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church</hi> may <hi>erre in faith,</hi> or to vſe your owne termes, that all the Church of God may be in errour, affirming and beleeuing contrarie to that which is true in faith.</p>
               <p n="83">83. And firſt I obſerue that if you did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your owne principles, you would diſpaire of the ſucceſſe of your owne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe by thoſe principles of yours all that you can ſay, may iuſtlie be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This I demonſtrate: for you will either prooue this doctrine of <hi>the Churches infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie in the ſenſe wherein wee defend it,</hi> to be an errour fundamentall, or to be ſome other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour not fundamentall. The firſt you cannot pretend without contradicting your ſelfe preſentlie, for you ſaie allſo that the Church cannot erre in fundamentalls, and that ours in fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>talls doth not erre, granting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all when you are well vrged, that ours is the Church, and if you should ſtart backe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it againe you will finde it vnder double proofe in another place. The Second you cannot as much as pretend to prooue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate in your principles, becauſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:344:152"/> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you can take no meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are certaine: not <hi>reaſon,</hi> for all men may erre in obſcure matters: nor <hi>Fathers,</hi> for in your principles all might erre: nor place of <hi>Scripture;</hi> for you haue no meanes to knowe certainlie that it is the word of God, the place not being one of your fundamentalles: nor the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe in not fundamentalls he aſſiſteth not, as you ſay and maintaine in this queſtion, or if he doth aſſiſt in this verie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether you call it fundamentall or not fundamentall, he doth aſſiſt the Church; for to the Church is the promiſe made.</p>
               <p n="84">84. Thus you very wiſelie haue ouer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched your ſelfe, and left your ſelfe no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes to prooue any thing againſt vs, either in this controuerſie or in any other, for funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentallie you confeſſe wee haue not erred, and in other things by your owne principles you are not certaine. Yet to gull the people, you bringe texts not fundamentall according to your diſtinction, and cry out Scripture Scripture, the Goſpell, the word of God. And if you finde a place in S. Auguſtine which neither your parishioners nor your ſelfe doe vnderſtand, you challenge vs to the Fathers, whereas in your conſcience you beleeue for certaine neither Fathers nor ſcripture, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie ſome places which you call fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:344:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> neither do you acknowledge anie meanes in the world either from God or man to be ſure of things not fundamentall (as you tearme them) as I haue shewed before: and the ſame theſe your proteſtant arguments which followe, would faine prooue.</p>
               <p n="85">85. The firſt argument to this end is made againſt the Church in the ſtate of the old lawe before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Meſſias and therfore is nothing to the purpoſe, becauſe wee ſpeake of the Chriſtian Church, as it is eſtablished by Ieſus Chriſt and gouerned by his Spirit, which Church is not limited vnto one Nation onelie, but ouer all the world, and therefore Catholique; and of this I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and wee do beleeue that in faith it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Notwithſtanding to maintaine the infallibilitie of the Iewish Church too before the Meſſias came (which is an other queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) I reſolue your doubt made againſt it. You ſay the people of Iſrael did adore the brazen calfe therefore the Church all did erre. You should haue prooued that all did adore the calfe, that Moyſes, and the Leuites all did: which you will neuer prooue as long as the Bible is extant. If you reade Exodus in the two and thitieth chapter you shall finde that when Moyſes had ſaide, if any man be our Lords let him ioyne to me, <hi>there gathered vnto
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:344:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> him all the Sonnes of Leuie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 32.26.</note> And theſe were no ſmall company as you may gather out of the booke of Numbers.<note place="margin">Num. 3. v. 39.</note> Next you ſay Elias did complaine that he was left alone, This makes a shewe, and is repeted ouer and ouer in your books and your pulpittes. The truth is that there were at the ſame tyme diuers in Iſrael where this Prophet was,<note place="margin">3. Kings. 19. v. 18. Rom. 11.4.</note> which bowed not before Baal, of which number God ſaid to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, he would reſerue ſeauen thouſand. And at the ſame tyme allſo in the kingdome of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da there was publique profeſſion of the true religion at Ieruſalem. Wherefore you cannot prooue by this place that the Church failed and was not viſible on the earth, if wee would graunt you (as you haue ſeene wee neede not) that it was not viſible in the kingdome of Iſrael at that tyme. Neither was it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to the viſibilitie of it, that it should be ſtill viſible in <hi>both kingdomes,</hi> one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doth ſuffice for this purpoſe, in caſe all in the other had forſaken God. Let vs now come to the Catholique and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>
               <p n="86">86. In the ſecond argument you taxe the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">1. Rainold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> and firſt accuſe S. Peeter of falſe doctrine becauſe he was reprehended by S. Paul. Then further you condemne the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles all of errour againſt faith, in not beleeui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:344:154"/> the reſurrection. To that of S. Peeter which old Heretiques obiected, it was anſweared fourteene hundred yeers agoe that it was a fault of <hi>conuerſation</hi> which he was taxed for, not of <hi>doctrine.</hi> The fault is ſet downe by S. Paul in theſe words,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>for before certaine came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iames, he,</hi> Peeter, <hi>did eate with the Gentiles, but when they were come he withdrewe and ſeparated himſelfe, fearing them that were of the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> This cariage of S. Peeter, S. Paul did repre-to Iudaize his making others by his example hend; and was in this. But here is no falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine maintained a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d published by him: much leſſe by the Apoſtles all, taught and generallie by the Church beleeued; whereof wee ſpeake now. In the conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Popes which you taxe by this occaſion there may haue bene faults allſo; for they were men; but from them in generall Councells there hath come no falſe doctrine, nor euer will.</p>
               <p n="87">87. The ſecond parr of your obiection hath no difficultie, becauſe wee knowe that the Apoſtles did learne the particulars of faith by degrees as you may obſerue eaſilie in the Goſpell: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their ſlownes to beleeue the point mentioned, but not any errour maintained by them for Chriſtian doctrine, was reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Neither was the all-teaching Spirit, as yet come; our Sauiour not being aſcended: who therefore did inſtruct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the matter
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:344:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> his owne ſelfe. Now the thinge that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend is, not that the Apoſtles beleeued all in particular from the firſt tyme they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or that in conuerſation nothing euer hapned amiſſe in any one of them, but <hi>that after the comming of the holie Ghoſt the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church did neuer beleeue or teach errour in matter of faith:</hi> which I would haue you to read ouer and ouer that you miſtake not the matter, but argue to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="88">88. A third argument which I thought good to put in this place touches the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith into the Church, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſeemes not firme becauſe it is made into authoritie not diuine. To this I anſweare that the authoritie of the Church alone if you conſider it apart, not adding thereunto the authoritie of the Aſſiſting Spirit, is greater then any other authoritie in the world that is diſtinct from the diuine authoritie. And this by reaſon of an infinite multitude of learned and holy men which are in it: of infinite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which doe giue teſtimonie of a greatnes which nature wonders at: of the ſtrange v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of worlds of people in one obſcure faith, with a conſtancie which neither flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery nor feare can shake, which vnion doth acknowledge no cauſe in nature, ſince nature inclines not ſo conſtantlie to communion a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:344:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> vniforme iudgment in things not found in nature, as God incarnate, the ſonne in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and power all one with his Father, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yet diſtinct in perſon, and the like. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie I ſay of the Church by reaſon of theſe and ſuch other motiues is the greateſt of all authorities among men: in ſo much that no other is any way equall to it: and therfore none able to drawe a wiſe man from it.</p>

Yet this alone is not the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto wee do make the laſt reſolution of our faith: But wee make it into <hi>the teſtimonie of allmightie God in the Church:</hi> This teſtimonie doth originallie moue our faith. The ſunne is allwayes viſible in it ſelfe; but cannot be ſeene of vs vnles it be in the Orbe aboue our hemiſphere: and when it is riſen, the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not principallie moue our eie, but the ſunne in that eleuation doth moue it to ſee both ſunne and heauen, and all other things which the light comes vppon. So Gods eternall word of it ſelfe is euer apt to moue, and to be ſeene, though wee cannot diſcouer it with the eie of faith, vnles it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or propoſed to vs in the firmament of the Church: or ſome other way equiualent. But if it be ſo applied our faith diſcerns the word and the Church propoſing it and all other things that are reuealed. Wherein the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:344:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> Church-propoſition doth concurre inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentallie, with ſubordination to the Word of God: and of them both in ſeuerall kinds our faith depends.</p>
               <p n="90">90. Wee reſolue therefore into authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie truely diuine; into the diuine Spirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church. Or, if you will haue a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger way, which in effect is all one, wee do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue into the preſent Church, aſſiſted with the Spirit: This preſent Church doth reſolue into the Church in the former age, aſſiſted by the Spirit; that againe into a former age, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo to the Apoſtles: they reſolue into Chriſt. Where you finde the like as before. that is, the eternall, and increated word, mouing by way of humane ſpeach: and the Apoſtles faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending (though diuerſlie) on both at once, that is, <hi>on the eternall word,</hi> as on the originall motiue: and, <hi>on the word of his mouth,</hi> as on the Application.</p>
               <p n="91">91. If you would haue yet another waie, take the motiues of faith all together, or the collection of them, as <hi>applications,</hi> and the prime veriry as <hi>formall obiect:</hi> and you haue all that you iuſtlie can deſire. In the collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of motiues I doe include the whole Church theſe ſixteene hundred yeares: and the Apoſtles and Ieſus Chriſt, as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and taught: and all the miracles
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:344:156"/> done in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of the Chriſtian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith: the conuerſion of the world from bad to good, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be from no bad cauſe: the prophecies of the old and newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and whatſoeuer els learned men vſe to bringe to this purpoſe. And taking in this collection <hi>all</hi> that which is diſtinct from the increated authoritie of allmightie God, I call it the condition, circumſtance or application of the formall obiect: which formall obiect is the diuine veritie reuealing. Further I muſt not goe, becauſe the diuine veritie is infinite, and therfore able to moue any vnderſtanding: and the circumſtances are beyond all exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to warrant the prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of my choiſe. I haue vſed ſome Schoole termes in this anſweare; but you muſt pardon me, for it is a Schoole point, as you knowe and fit for Schollers onelie.</p>
               <p n="92">92. A fourth exception is, that you ſeeke the will of God more ſincerely, and therefore enioy the aſſiſtance, which wee doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee relie onely on men. This argument is allreadie anſweared in effect: wee depend on men propoſing and as inſtrumentall, or miniſteriall cauſes vnder Ieſus Chriſt the greate Paſtor: And ſure the Apoſtles on whome the primitiue Church depended were men allſo. But principallie wee depend
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:344:156" rendition="simple:additions"/> on Ieſus Chriſt, and the holie Ghoſt aſſiſting in a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the Church. For your ſincere ſeeking of the <hi>truth</hi> it is a friuolous pretenſe, ſince you do not take the meanes by God ordained to finde it. Ieſus Chriſt hath left it <hi>in the Church,</hi> and if you would finde it, you should looke it there. Your pretence of prayer, and the guift of interpretation, and conference of places, are trickes onelie to delude fooles; for all wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowe that Chriſt hath beſtowed all helpes neceſſary vppon the Church: and that in the Church are the power of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and ſanctitie, and generallie all the guifts of the holy Ghoſt. Wherefore you are firſt to prooue that you are the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you challenge the Spirit, and his guifts: till then wee number you amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thoſe who come in at the windowe to rob and ſteale the ſoules out of men; and indeuour allſo as much as lies in you to rob the Church of God of her endowments.</p>
               <p n="93">93. For the ſanctitie of our Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you would equall yours, I remitte you to Baronius Martyrologe, and deſire to ſee the like catalogue from your holie number. But who knowes not that it is proper to the Catholique Church to breede Saints, and that thence are thoſe which out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tribes, and tongues, are choſen to raigne
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:344:157" rendition="simple:additions"/> with Iesꝰ Chriſt. Yet are not all in this Church truelie Saincts: there are degrees of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vnion to the heade and members. Some are vnited by faith and charitie, ſome by faith and exterior communion, but want Charitie, and they haue ſome kinde of motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and influence from Chriſt the heade: for without him none can beleeue a right: and they are part of the great myſticall body the Church. Yet they want the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall vnion; which vnion will be perfect and conſtant in heauen, where the Church shall ſee the deitie of the ſonne of God; But here, good and bad are mixt: yet ſo, that the Church militant shall neuer be without many good and holie men, according to the Scripture <hi>This is the couenant which I will make with the houſe of Iſrael ſaith our Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 30. v. 33.</note> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>I will giue my lawe in their bowells, and in the hart of them will write it, and will be to them a God, and they shall be my people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 37. v 27.</note> And in Ezechiel. <hi>I will giue my ſanctification in the middest of them for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="94">94. If you aske me whether the Church may be ſaid to ſinne, ſince there be ſinners in the Church. I anſweare, no. If any ſinne, it is not by meanes of the Church; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to her direction and Spirit. And, if any
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:344:157"/> erre, it is not by her meanes, but contrarie to her Spirit and propoſition. So that, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>ſinne,</hi> nor the <hi>errour</hi> of particular men can iuſtlie be attributed vnto the Church, ſince they worke not in thoſe caſes by the <hi>common iudgment</hi> and direction of the Church, but by their owne priuate appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and affections contrary to the Churches <hi>will</hi> and <hi>rule.</hi> As when one in a well-inſtituted common-wealth doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie ſteale, and murder; it is his priuate action: it is not the action of the common wealth, but flatlie againſt the will and lawes of it. This onely I will note in this matter, that euery mortall ſinne doth not deſtroy all incorporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and therefore a man may be in mortall ſinne, and yet in the Church, for he which beleeueth, doth participate ſome kinde of life, though imperfect as I ſaid before. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it neceſſarie that in each part all vitall powers be: for a mans foote doth participate life but cannot ſee, nor heare, nor imagine as doth the heade.</p>
               <p n="95">95. In the next place inſteede of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I note your vanitie in heaping things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to winne the vulgar. Your ſilken diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes vnles they be flowred with hiſtories of Popes, Friars and Monkes, are not gaudie, and therefore this embrodery muſt not be
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:344:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> wanting. I will not looſe tyme to rehearſe the particulars, but in generall anſweare thus. <hi>Firſt</hi> if amonge twelue Apoſtles pict out by our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, one was naught and proued an Apoſtata, it can be no meruaile if amonge more then two hundred Popes elected by men, ſome fewe did amiſſe, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can their faults preiudice Papall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the generall doctrine of the Church, or redound vnto it, more then did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie of Iudas preiudice Apoſtolicall power, and chriſtianitie, or redound vnto the reſt. You should haue conſidered rather, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Bishops of the Roman See are knowne Saincts.</p>
               <p n="96">96. I anſweare <hi>ſecondlie</hi> for Friars, that their rule is good, holie, and beyond all iuſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore if any not conforming themſelues to this rule, by weaknes faile and liue amiſſe, the profeſſion is no more to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned for it, then is Chriſtianitie for the wicked conuerſation of many that profeſſe it. And the ſtories of Friars which you haue are but fewe, ſome dozen peraduenture, were they a thouſand the matter were not greate, whereas in all the Catholique world are Friars. And touching Monkes it is the ſame; their Rule is holie and their conuerſation

               <p n="97">97. Of Catholiques in generall I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all readie: they were not all ſaincts in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, neither be they all ſaincts at this day. <hi>Many are called fewe choſen:</hi> Good a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bad are mingled here: The ſpouſe is blacke a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d faire. In the Churches decrees there is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt faith; no rule againſt manners: Her rule is irreprehenſible, being the rule of Chriſtianitie; And when any thing is amiſſe in mens cariage or behauiour towards God or man, she doth admonish and punish as occaſion requires. Hence haue come all thoſe decrees of reformation made in Councells generall and particular, which you haue ſeene more then once. In an infinite number to haue ſome diſorders is incident, and wee were foretould that ſcandalls should be.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> But conſider further, that this Church hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of holie men likewiſe, and that

For this very Church, though not according to all the materiall parts, shall triumphe, as I haue ſaid in an other place, and in ſtate of triumphe, shall be all faire, and all ouer without ſpot: she shall be without actuall or originall or veniall ſinne, when she comes with open eies to looke the prime veritie in the face, and to embrace the diuine goodnes, with all the latitude of her ſoule.</p>

                  <hi>THE SIXT CHAPTER.</hi> Of the Proteſtant multiplication of Churches by viſible and inuiſible.</head>
               <p n="68">68. IN this place before I conclude I haue a word more to ſay about your diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of viſible and inuiſible. I thought once to make it a Chapter in the firſt booke; one of your greate leaps when you are purſued en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it. From Luthers Schoole you skip into Waldoes, from thence you thruſt your ſelues on vs, from vs to the Church primitiue and from the primitiue Church you get quite out of the eies of the whole world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelues to <hi>Inuiſibilitie.</hi> In regard I there purſued you, I thought (I ſay) to ſpeake
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:344:159"/> allſo of the diſtinction there: But the thinge will be more eaſie now becauſe in many places as occaſions were offered I haue diſcouſed of the<note n="*" place="bottom">He that deſires to ſee more of the <hi>Viſibilitie</hi> of the Church, shall find it exactly handled, and the Proteſtant euaſions all cleerely refuted by L. my of Chalc. in his booke <hi>de auctorae eſſentia Protestantica Eccleſia.</hi> l. 2. c. 6. &amp; ſeqq.</note> 
                  <hi>Viſibilitie of Gods Church.</hi> The Church of Gods is <hi>one</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> as the Scripture doth witnes: Yet you with two words <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inuiſible,</hi> haue made a diſtinction to rend it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two, and do maintaine ſtoutlie that God hath two Churches, one inuiſible, conſiſting of predeſtinate perſons onelie, The other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which doth exteriorlie profeſſe the faith.</p>
               <p n="99">99. The whole companie of the faith full may be deuided into two parts by God all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, the one part is predeſtinate, the other part is the companie of thoſe which are not predeſtinate. By this, the whole is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie deuided, for euerie man in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie belongs to one part or member of the diuiſion, and no man belongs to both. For you cannot affirme two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories of the ſame, as to ſay, Peeter is predeſtinated, and Peeter is not predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This being ſo I demaund now which of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:344:160"/> theſe companies is viſible, and which inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? And what makes the one to be ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the other? If predeſtination make men inuiſible, whie doth not reprobation make men inuiſible, ſince reprobation is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret as hard to knowe? If profeſſion of the faith make the reprobate viſible, whie can not profeſſion make the predeſtinate men vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? And if theſe companies be together mingled, why are they not both viſible, or both inuiſible? or rather whie is not the whole companie viſible, by reaſon of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and communion, though Gods diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards this and that man in particular be inuiſible and ſecret?</p>
               <p n="100">100. Wee beleeue that the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Catholiques is the Church, as I haue declared larglie heretofore: Wee beleeue that the predeſtinate are in this companie: that they die all of them in the communion of the Church: and that here they profeſſe their faith. This I will declare brieflie, and then I will be ſo bould as to demand ſome queſtions touching your inuiſible congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for looke on it I may not, becauſe it is not to be ſeene.</p>
               <p n="101">101. Firſt therefore if the thing be well conſidered it is manifeſt that the predeſtinate doe profeſſe their faith, and thereby do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:344:160"/> themſelues to be the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt: and this allſo our Sauiour Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of his ſeruants,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.32.33.</note>

                  <hi>But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the Angells of God.</hi> Herevpon the Martyrs of Ieſus Chriſt which haue bene at all tymes, and whereof all Chriſtian Nations haue yeelded ſtore; haue openlie in the face of perſecution made profeſſion of their faith, and thereby they were viſible, and being Martyrs were allſo members of the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Church, they were predeſtinate. The predeſtinate therefore, and the viſible profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the faith may be in one and the ſame Church, yea the ſame man may be predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and allſo viſiblie profeſſe the faith.</p>
               <p n="102">102. Secondlie it is manifeſt that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were viſible profeſſors of the faith, and therefore members of the viſible Church of God; and they were allſo predeſtinate and therefore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the predeſtinate Church: The ſame men therefore may be viſible and predeſtinate. The ſame Church may be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and predeſtinate: and conſequentlie viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:344:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> and predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuide not the Church into two Churches. As I ſaid of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, ſo I ſay of the holie Doctors of the Church: they did preach and teach viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, they were knowne farre and neere, and were ptedeſtinate allſo, whereby it is manifeſt that the predeſtinate did profeſſe their faith the ſame faith with other Catholiques, with others in their communion, and were viſible.</p>
               <p n="103">103. Thirdlie the Apoſtolique Church is viſible, it includes eſſentiallie publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, As Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall men for conuerſion of Nations; Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; Paſtors; Doctors, as you knowe by Scripture: Now theſe publike perſons are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtlie viſible: Paſtors, to their flocke: Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to their Dioceſe, Apoſtles and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall men to the Nations they conuert: The Apoſtolicall Chutch therefore is viſible. And you knowe further that the holie Catholique and Apoſtolicall Church are one and the ſame, for ſo it is in the Creede. <hi>I beleeue one holie Catholique and Apoſtolicall Church:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Symb. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note> and this Creede you profeſſe that you beleeue, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you put it allſo amonge the fundamentalls of your faith. The <hi>Catholik</hi> therefore and <hi>holy</hi> Church is viſible.</p>
               <p n="104">104. Fourthlie, if the Church be the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:344:161"/> bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, and this bodie one, whereof viſible men are members, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate allſo members of the ſame; then are there not <hi>two</hi> Churches of Chriſt, one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the other inuiſible; Now, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by the teſtimonie of holie Scripture that the Church is the myſticall bodie of Chriſt, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that this myſticall bodie, is but <hi>one,</hi> wherein are viſible and predeſtinated perſons therefore there are not two Churches of Chriſt, one viſible, the other inuiſible; two bodies one viſible, the other inuiſible; but all appertaine to one bodie, and one Church. I confirme this out of S. Paul who in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle the Epheſians ſaith, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath made Chriſt, <hi>the heade ouer all the Church which is his bodie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. v 22.23. Ch. 4. v. 13.</note> In this Church the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, Chriſt put Apoſtles, <hi>paſtors</hi> &amp;c. till wee <hi>all meete into the vnitie of faith,</hi> which is till the end of the world:<note place="margin">Chap. 2.19. Ch. 1. v. 13.</note> and in the ſame Church are <hi>the citizens of the Saincts: the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticalls of God, Thoſe which are ſigned with the holie Ghoſt of promiſe which is the pledge of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance:</hi> in fine the predeſtinate: and S. Paul himſelfe, was in this Church. This one bodie therefore had theſe two attributs to wit, it <hi>was viſible,</hi> for hauing in it intrinſecallie and for euer publike perſons, Paſtors, Doctors, it might thereby be ſeene and heard: and <hi>it had
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:344:162"/> in it the predeſtinate,</hi> which you call inuiſible men; whence it followes that viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible in that ſenſe leaue it ſtill as it was, <hi>one bodie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="105">105. Fiftlie our greate Paſtors fould is <hi>one,</hi> not two as your diſtinction makes it. He hath one fould: and that is <hi>viſible.</hi> For the Church of God is viſible as I haue manifeſtlie decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, and to this fould his predeſtinate are all brought, out of what Nation, out of what part of the world ſoeuer. <hi>Other sheepe I haue that are not of this fold</hi> (a fould wherein the Apoſtles were,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.16.</note> men viſible to the whole world, and wherein their ſucceſſors are, men allſo viſible) <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allſo I muſt bringe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they shall heare my voice, and there shall be made one fould and one Paſtor.</hi> Heere by the teſtimonie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the fould, the Church is <hi>one:</hi> away then with your diſtinction; beleeue <hi>one,</hi> as wee doe, which is viſible, in which the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people are.</p>
               <p n="106">106. And indeede, where should one looke for our Sauiours Schollers, but in his Schoole? where should wee looke for Gods domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls, but in his howſe? where should wee looke for his members but in his body? where should wee looke for holie people, for prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, for Saincts but in the Church? And therefore hauing demonſtrated before which
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:344:162"/> is the Church, this labour might haue bene ſpared. For as I anſweared of the Spirit; that you should not challenge him till you had prooued that yours was the Church (a taske vnpoſſible,) ſo now I may anſweare of holie people, of predeſtinate, of Saints, that you do not callenge any till you haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (which you will not doe as longe as God is God) that yours is the Church.</p>
               <p n="107">107. It is verily a ridiculous thing to ſee what Churches you frame in your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: One, full of words, euer preaching, all mouth, but without Spirit, without hart, without sowle. The other, full of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Spirit, but ſilent, and ashamed of her owne doctrine, in ſo much that for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres together she was dombe: a church without a mouth. The mouth and hart you knowe, are both parts of one man: the hart is within, and is not ſeene but by the mouth; in the mouth it doth shewe it ſelf in what forme it pleaſeth to affect: The Church too hath <hi>hart</hi> and <hi>mouth,</hi> hart to beleeue, to loue God, and mouth to praiſe, inuoake and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him. Theſe make not two Churches, they are two parts of one. God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe two to one, and the ſame Church. his ſpirit is allwayes in her hart, and his words allwayes in her mouth. <hi>I will aske my Father

               <p n="108">108. Neither doth predeſtination make it inuiſible as childishly you imagine. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſelfe indeede is inuiſible vnto vs, it is Gods purpoſe and decree, and therefore is in God, as mans purpoſes are in the mind of man: and thoſe purpoſes euen in men are ſecret and hidden till the men reueale them: But the predeſtinated as I ſaid before are as viſible as other men. So was S. Peeter, S. Paul, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, the Martyres of Ieſus Chriſt were viſible, otherwiſe, how
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:344:163"/> could they haue bene tortured as they were? The Doctors were viſible, S. Ierome and S.

And is ſo, though euery man in the Church be not predeſtinate, ſome are there more then number, as in a mans body there are ſome parts ſuperfluous, which will not be reſumed in the reſurrection as I ſaid in the former booke, and theſe parts are like the reſt, they communicate with the reſt, they beleeue as the reſt, but they doe not perſeuer as the reſt. Now which thoſe are that will perſeuere fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie, which will not, God hath reſerued as a ſecret vnto himſelfe. He hath not as yet made any ſecretarie coppie out of the booke of life.

IF any of your arguments should eſcape vntouched you would bragge of their ſtreingth, and therefore I am glad I haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken other two before they gette out of my memorie. The firſt is;<note place="margin">Whittak. Rainolds.</note> That which may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any one, may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all or to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one; But to erre may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any Church (adde, for ought you know) for thus it did happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Churches of Thiatira, Corinth, &amp;c. therefore it may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery one or to all, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo all at o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may erre. Thus you. I haue ſome cauſe to thinke you haue a wide mouth, ſuppoſe you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thruſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> egge into it; A clowne there might diſpute in your forme a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d moode thus. That which may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any one of the egges in your parish may happen to all or to euerie one; but to be thruſt into your mouth <hi>at once,</hi> may happen to any one of thoſe egges therefore it may happen to them all, and then your mouth will be ſtopt. Now if one mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full be not inough for your dinner, you may fall next to the meate and eate it all euery bit, for that which may happen to any bit may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to euery bit the clowne your Scholler
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:344:171"/> would ſay; and ofterwards at the ſame meale you might drinke all the drinke, euery cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, euery drop.</p>
               <p n="122">122. Suppoſe all the men in England should caſt the dice for a thouſand pound, with theſe conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that the firſt which threwe twelue with two dice should haue it, and if none threwe twelue the monie, should be yours. To ſee faire play a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to doe you all the fauour wee can; wee will ſuppoſe the dice to be iuſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no tricke vſed at all. The firſt may throwe ames ace: I ſuppoſe the leaſt for your good: but it is fiue to one he will not. Yet admitt he doth. It is fiue to one the ſecond doth not: yet admitt his caſt be ames ace too: for what cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce might happen to the other might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him. Thus I will run on till I come to twentie, and ſurelie it is much that twentie, one after another should haue the ſame caſt and the dice exactlie iuſt. It is not probable that it would hould on ſo to a hundred: yet what might happen to any one, might happen ſay you to euery one: It is incredible it should goe on in the ſame cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: yet in your logicke this guggion muſt be ſwallowed after his fellowes. But that it should run thorough them all it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for then fortune would be conſtant and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tingencie would prooue to be a neeeſſity, which no man will ſay, who knowes what
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:344:171"/> he ſaith: yet this muſt downe your throate too, for <hi>what may happen to any one may happen to euerie one,</hi> that ſo in the end you may get to your ſelfe the thouſand pound. The like might happen if all the men that are in the world should caſt the dice and should haue done ſo euer ſince dice were firſt inuented: becauſe <hi>what might happen to any one might</hi> as you ſay <hi>happen to euery one.</hi> And when each had throwne he might die before you and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie all might doe ſo in your principles ſo you should be the onelie man a liue a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d haue all their money too. And thus much to let you ſee the weake forme of your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which nothwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is one of the maine foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s where on your me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do build their doctrine of the fallibility of Gods Church.</p>
               <p n="123">123. Now to the matter of the argument I anſweare, that allmighiie God is infinite, and therfore none can hinder his deſigne or make fruſtrate his intention. Wherfore ſince he hath decreed to keepe allwayes to the worlds end a Church on earth infallible in doctrine as I haue declared by the teſtimony of holy Scripture, his prouidence will effect it, and make it perſeuere in what perſons and what places he pleaſe. Wee haue no reuelation thath the true faith shall perſeuere allwayes in France, or in England for example, but in

Neither doth it followe: God permittes ſome tymes one man to fall into Apoſtaſie, ſome tymes another, therfore he will at once permitte all: he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes diuers to die before you, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (for ought you knowe) he may permitte any one man whom ſoeuer you can name or thinke of, yea any one in all the world: yet hence it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te that it ſtands with his generall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to permitt euery one to die before you that ſo you may be laſt, the onelie man a liue.

This is the vp shott of your diſputation, this is the hauen you haue all this while bene ſailing vnto: this (though firſt but a shifte wherunto you were driuen by the ſtrength of authoritie brought againſt you) is now your doctrine and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in your bookes.

Thus generall Councells are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, thus were the Euangeliſts allſo, and thus the Prophetts, though nor after the ſame manner all.

For, whence is their ſtrength? from <hi>witte</hi> or from <hi>authoritie?</hi> If from <hi>witt,</hi> you muſt not thinke amiſſe of me, if I preferre the witt and iudgment of many worlds of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before yours which hath declared it ſelfe vnreaſonable hetherto: eſpeciallie ſince all men be lyars, to turne the point of your owne weapon vppon your ſelfe, and you no God nor Angell but a man. If your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:344:177"/> haue their ſtreingth from <hi>authoritie;</hi> either this authoritie is of men, and this you haue refuſed as vncertaine becauſe all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are lyars. and you haue laboured not onelie to diſgrace the Church of later tymes, and the Fathers in their age, but allſo to take the Apoſtles tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and therefore their authoritie moues not you. Or this authoritie is of God in holie Scripture; where he deliuers, according to your diſtinction, two ſorts of points, the one is of <hi>fundamentall points,</hi> and in theſe you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the Church neither doth nor can erre: and therfore the enſuing controuerſie is not about them, as for example, the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the paſſion, and the reſt which you call fundamentall. The other ſort of points or textes in the Bible are as you call them <hi>not-fundamentall;</hi> and theſe you do not hold for certaine; which, howſoeuer you diſſemble the matter, is cleere, for in your principles there are no meanes from God or man to <hi>knowe certainlie</hi> that they are indeede parts of Gods word, or to knowe which is their true meaning. Not the <hi>witte</hi> of man alone, for that may erre eſpeciallie in ſuch an obſcure point, as whether this text, this verſe, be Gods word and not the word of a man: Not the <hi>Spirit,</hi> for that doth aſſiſt onelie to fundamentalls you
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:344:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſaie, and theſe you ſay are not of them. you muſt anſwer this heere, before you goe fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: and knowe that of the certainty of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> it is the ſame. Moreouer, ſince diuine aſſiſtance to the vnderſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, depends vppon Gods promiſe; and ſince this promiſe is made vnto the Church, to the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors: you are <hi>firſt to prooue</hi> that you are the Church, before any man is to beleeue you haue the aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d interprete right: for, arguments out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prooue nothing, if they miſſe the ſenſe of God, and be grounded in a wronge ſenſe. For theſe, and the like reaſons I might haue forborne to make further anſweare to your exceptions. Notwithſtanding, to giue you content I will deſcende vnto the particular conſideration of the chiefeſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Firſt therefore, to make your waie into the Church, there to ſpoile and aulter what you liſt, you ſet vppon the Paſtor. It is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Councell of Florence that the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome is ſucceſſor to ſainct Peeter, and that he hath receaued in him, ſainct Peeter, from our Sauiour, power to feede and to gouerne the whole Church. This is one of the things which you cannot abide; a Superiour you thinke is a heauie burden, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore you would shake him of. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſay you, were according to Cyprian
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:344:178"/> 
                  <hi>equall in honour and dignitie.</hi>

                  <hi>The ſtrength of the Church was equallie eſtablished on them all</hi> in the opinion of Hierom, and with Leo, they had <hi>a likenes in honour.</hi> This is the firſt onſet, wherein you shewe neither skill nor iudgment. You had but latelie diſcharged all the Fathers for vnable men, and therefore it was an vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed part in you now to ſummo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to fight vnder your colours: for you may iuſtlie feare that in tyme of tryall they will declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſide who haue euer reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p n="3">3. But <hi>I</hi> anſweare, that before <hi>S.</hi> Peeter was made Paſtor, the Apoſtles were all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall: after he was made Paſtor, they were not equall. S. Peeter was then chiefe a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Superior. The reſt of the Apoſtles had power giuen them to preach the Goſpell, to forgiue ſinnes, to binde a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d looſe, to doe miracles: but onelie S. Peeter had the prerogatiue of Paſtor, as the Scripture doth euidentlie declare. And heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was otherwiſe compared vnto the flocke then any of the reſt,<note place="margin">

This is the doctrine of thoſe Fathers which you haue cited, as you may ſee in their books; and to ſaue you the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of looking further, <hi>I</hi> will shewe it in the very ſame places you alleage. <hi>The Church</hi> (ſaith S.

Peeter was made Paſtor, they were all equallie made Apoſtles, and foundations, and had equallie the keyes: but afterwards, of theſe Apoſtles thus equall, one was created Paſtor, the reſt remaining as they were; who remained therefore vnequall to this <hi>one,</hi> which was Peeter,<note place="margin">10. 21.</note> as you know by the Goſpell of S.

                  </note> Heere S. Cyprian doth shew what courſe Our bleſſed Sauiour tooke, to keepe manifeſt, vnitie in his Church, and among the Apoſtles themſelues. He, our Sauiour, diſpoſed, being muſt wiſe, an Origen, Roote, or cauſe of Vnitie, which Vnitie he would haue in his Church and amongſt all the Parts of it. This Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Roote, was not a multitude equally gouerning the Church, but it was <hi>ONE,</hi> that is Peeter, whom our Sauiour made Paſtor, of his Church, and vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he built it, as S.

Peeter, in that he is the Roote and Origen of Vnitie in the whole Body, wherein the Apoſtles were; and allſo the reaſon of the Inſtitution of this Primacie, or Origen in One. In another place he doth ſpecifie it more particularly ſaying that, <hi>The Origen of Eccleſiaſticall Vnitie is the

                  <hi>of Peeter.</hi> And now I hope you wil beleeue it is his mind, heering it out of his owne mouth.

Cyprian ſaith the See of Rome is <hi>the Mother</hi> or Matrice <hi>and Roote of the Catholique Church.</hi> Now if S.

I demand ſecondly which of all the Fathers after him did note this doctrine <hi>in him,</hi> an erroneous or not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant? He was a greate Scholler, and a Sainct, and in the communion of all the Chriſtian
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:344:180"/> world in his tyme. Yet to giue you further content, I will put downe the Scripture whereon the doctrine of S. Leo, S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the reſt, is grounded. There be two chiefe places, the firſt is in the 16. of S. Matth. <hi>And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwearing ſaid, bleſſed art thou Simon Bar Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp;c. and I ſay to thee, thou art Peeter, and VP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PON THIS ROCKE will I build</hi> MY <hi>Church.</hi> or thus <hi>I, ſay to thee,</hi> Simon, <hi>thou art Cephas, and, vppon this Cephas,</hi> which thou art, <hi>I will build, My Church.</hi> Heere the demonſtratiue, <hi>this,</hi> doth point at the thing whereuppon the Church is built, <hi>vppon this Cephas will I build my Church.</hi> and Simon is this thing, <hi>Thou,</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>art Cephas, and vppon this I build.</hi> This ſenſe you cannot <hi>EXCLVDE</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the words of Ieſus Chriſt.

                  <hi>Peeter:</hi> for our Sauiour was as good as his word, and he ſaid he would doe it. <hi>The ſecond:</hi> The <hi>reſt of the Apoſtles</hi> were built <hi>vppon Peeter:</hi> For, if they were <hi>the Church</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, they were built vppon him, becauſe <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Church,</hi> which was but one in all, was <hi>built on him;</hi> Or, if they were <hi>in the Church</hi> of Ieſus Chriſt, as <hi>partes</hi> in the <hi>whole,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">If the <hi>Whole</hi> be built vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> each part <hi>in that whole</hi> is built thereon.</note> this Church this <hi>whole</hi> being built on Peeter, <hi>on this rocke will I build my Church,</hi> they, being contained therein, that is, being parts of <hi>the</hi> whole thing <hi>built</hi> on Peeter, were allſo built on Peeter. And ſo Peeter, was their <hi>Foundation,</hi> and their <hi>Heade,</hi> ſubordinate vnto Chriſt, the chiefe <hi>Heade</hi> and maine <hi>Foundation</hi> of them <hi>all.</hi> You cannot auoide this diſcourſe; becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were not Infidelles or Heretiques, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore, <hi>either</hi> they were <hi>the Church,</hi> or, they were <hi>in the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond place is that in the Goſpell of ſainct Iohn. Peeter, <hi>Feede my sheepe,</hi> by which words, ſainct Peeter peculiarlie, is made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor

Your labour is to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall others with him in authoritie. To this purpoſe, you firſt make vſe of the Grecians proceedings in the Councell of Chalcedon, where the Byshops you ſay, did equall the Conſtantinopolitan See with the Roman. I anſweare firſt, that this adequation preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was not in originall or prime authoritie, but in matter of priuiledge, as in the words it is expreſlie ſet downe, <hi>to enioy equall priuiledges &amp;c.</hi>

                  </note> Now priuiledge is a diſtinct thinge from originall authoritie, and acceſſorie thereunto. The priuiledges they did ayme at were that the Biſshop of Conſtantinople should in his proportion haue a maieſtie in Eccleſiaſticall affaires aboue other Sees (Rome excepted) in regard that Conſtantinople was then the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall ſeate, as before Rome had bene, and

And with all, that he should ordaine Metropolitans in the Dioceſes of Pontus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and Thrace. Theſe priuiledges they did aime at, and hereby would haue had a kinde of analogie with the Romane Bishop. this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Grecians, Leo then Pope, would by no meanes approue, and the decree which the Bishops had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued he did anulle. <hi>Wee do vtterly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>make void and by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the bleſsed Apoſtle Peeter,</hi>

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:344:184"/> the Bishop of Alexandria to be thus equall to the Roman, and that the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſshop was there limited by the Councell as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I haue looked on that canon, but ſee nothing for your purpoſe. The Biſshop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria is not ſaid there to be equall to the Roman Bishop, neither is there any ſpeach of limiting the Roman to the weſt, as you pretend. The words are,<note place="margin">Conc. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. can 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the auncient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome be kept in Aegypt, Libia and Pentapolis, that the Biſshop of Alexandria haue power ouer all theſe, becauſe the Roman Biſshop hath ſuch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> Here the Popes cuſtome, is a reaſon whie the Biſshop of Alexandria is to haue power ouer Aegypt, Libia, and Pentapolis; whereby is inſinuated that the Biſshop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria therein depended on the Popes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner of gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which argues a ſuperioritie in the Pope, not an equalitie in the other.

               <p n="11">11. Failing againe this way, you ſtand ſtill like a ſtocke, and refuſe to acknowledge any ſucceſſor to ſainct Peeter in his generall care and Paſtorall office, becauſe you cannot ſee what neceſſitie there is of a Succeſſor.

A Succeſſor in that office, was, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, <hi>firſt</hi> becauſe the Church at all tymes needs a generall Paſtor, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d viſible Foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well as it did in the begining: ſince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church is to endure till the worlds e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<note place="margin">Viſible <hi>Paſtor</hi> ſuch as ſainct Peeter was</note> the Paſtor a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d viſible Fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt likewiſe endure, to confirme and to direct it. <hi>ſecondlie,</hi> Peeter in perſon, could not feede a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rule all the sheepe of Chriſt, from his tyme till the words end, our Sauiour therefore prouiding the Church of a Paſtor that might feede a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d rule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did in the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:344:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnderſtand his Succeſſors, in that office, that ſo the sheepe might allwayes haue a Paſtor to rule and feede them. Otherwiſe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the flocke, that is all after S, Peeters dayes, till the worlds end should haue no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Paſtor here on earth though they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him no leſſe, yea more then did the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in ſainct Peeters time. <hi>Thirdlie</hi> the beſt forme of gouerment is Monarchicall, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tempered with Ariſtocracie, and the more Nations are added to the Church the more neede of a Monarch. One, is vndeuided in himſelfe, his iudgment and his principles are the ſame, but a multitude is diuided; a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the greater the multitude, the more varietie of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the greater the varietie of inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgment is the more neede there is of a cauſe of Vnitie to keepe them in <hi>One,</hi> which would neuer be if euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freelie might choſe his way, and be a rule vnto himſelfe. Wee ſee this in Heretiques, who hauing no viſible cauſe of vnion in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, doe runne ſundry wayes, Arius one, Neſtorius another, and ſo to the very laſt. Philoſophers, ould and moderne haue gonne ſeuerall waies, and filld the Schooles with queſtions; which will neuer be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their iudgments being directed by no One. Seuerall Nations haue diuers lawes
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:344:186"/> according to the different opinions of their Rulers and Lawe-makers, the like would be in England, if each Shire were independent of another, and of a Monarch or common co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner. In religion allſo each Miniſter would haue his way. Now the Church was to haue it it all Nations, and in them is infinite varietie of iudgment,<note place="margin">10. 10. id. c. 21.</note> wherefore our Sauiour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them all in <hi>one,</hi> did ordaine a Monarch, <hi>there shall be made one Fould and one Paſtor. Peeter feede my sheepe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> And tempering this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie with Ariſtocracie, <hi>he putte Byſshops</hi> allſo <hi>to rule the Church. Fourthlie,</hi> it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that in the Church there should be one to attend generallie to the whole; to call gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells; to be Preſident there, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the multitude of Bishops in Vnitie; and to haue a care principallie of the Churches generall affaires, which care our Sauiour gaue to ſainct Peeter as an Ordinarie Office, in that he made him <hi>Paſtor</hi> of his <hi>Fold,</hi> the Chriſtian Church: and if it were neceſſarie then in the Apoſtles daies, much more it is now. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Paſtors are to continue in the Church till the end of the world by the doctrine of S. Paul; therefore the chiefe Paſtor is likewiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, which could not be in one perſon, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore in diuers. If you ſay that our Sauiour himſelfe is chiefe Paſtor,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> I replie that amonge <hi>viſible</hi> Paſtors one is chiefe, though ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:344:186"/> vnto Chriſt, and he is to remaine as well as the reſt of the clergie: and his exiſtence is neceſſarie for the Gouerment of the Church. Our Sauiour doth continuallie teach and baptize, but by others, and ſo doth he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine the Church in Vnity and gouerne by ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate meanes ordained and inſtituted for this purpoſe, as God lights the world with the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne though if he had ſo pleaſed he could haue donne it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12. What you pretend about Election of a Succeſſor, is not hard, the Church deſignes the Perſon, and then he receaues power from our Sauiour <hi>in vertue of the firſt inſtitution:</hi> as man diſpoſeth matter in the generation of a man, and nature preſents it ſo prepared vnto the Creator, who by vertue of the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of mankinde inſpires a ſowle which the generant could not make. It is true that the Churches action is hindered ſometymes by Schiſme or other meanes, as mans genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is likewiſe hindred otherwhile, but ſuch hindrances are in tyme remoued, and the Succeſſor deſigned. Neither is the Succeſſion interrupted properlie in this tyme, becauſe this Election is a continuation of it. So that, all you haue ſaid about the tyme of Schiſme might haue bene ſpared, becauſe then the Church was buſie in determining a ſucceſſor,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:344:187" rendition="simple:additions"/> though she were hindred ſometymes more, ſometymes leſſe, according to the difficulties which did occurre.</p>
               <p n="13">13. To conclude your oppoſition in this matter, you take vpon you not to knowe, who doth ſuccede ſainct Peeter. But if you had lookt aboute, you could not haue doubted. <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe noe Bishop in the Church euer yet was eſtemed, or did pretende to be aboue the Roman Bishop: ſince therefore S. Peeter was putte in charge of the flocke of Chriſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made Paſtor of the Church, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſince this office of generall Paſtor doth remaine, it followes that the Bishop of Rome is a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtill was he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is and euer was confeſſedlie the firſt Bishop in the Church. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> the Pope of Rome by your confeſſion, hath exerciſed the Office of Generall Paſtor of the Church theſe thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeares, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cells the ſame is cleere, neither was there any other all this tyme who did exerciſe or take on him that Office: not the Biſshop of Antioch, nor of Conſtantinople, for theſe Biſshops, and the moſt ancient Councells, as the Nicene, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan and others did acknowledge Rome before thoſe Sees. Neither was the See without a Succeſſor all this tyme, as I haue shewed before, becauſe the Paſtor and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is neceſſarie to the Flocke and Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

                  <hi>THE THIRD CHAPTER.</hi> The Bishop of Rome Preſident in Generall Councells.</head>
               <p n="15">15. YOur next pretenſe is that the Pope hath no title to be Preſident in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells, or to call or approoue them, though he hath practiſed theſe things now of late. Before I anſwere to this argument, to shewe more cleerelie wherein the force of it doth lie, you are with me to obſerue two things, the <hi>firſt</hi> is that there are two kinds of calling a Councell, One is <hi>Ecleſiaſticall</hi> in way and forme of ordination, the other is <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> in way of execution. The Queſtion is of the former, which is pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipall, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wee are in it to ſee whether any man in the world hath ſuch authoritie to call a Councell ſo as the Bishops are in regard of that calling <hi>bound to come.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> obſeruation is, that one may haue the place of Preſident in <hi>his owne</hi> name, or in the name and <hi>place of another,</hi> to whom principallie it belongeth: and this Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie may be either to ſome <hi>temporall end,</hi> as to keepe exterior order and peace in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or to a <hi>ſpirituall end,</hi> which is to iudge and define matters of beleefe, and to
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:344:189"/> eſtablish Church diſcipline by decree. The queſtion is of this ſecond kinde of Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie not of the firſt, And, who is <hi>principall in this kinde</hi> as hauing power to doe it either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or by his deputie: whereunto, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your obiection, I anſweare that it is the Pope, to whom belongs properlie to call, moderate, and approoue Generall Councells, becauſe he is aboue another Bishops, and Succeſſor to ſainct Peeter in the gouerment of the whole Church. Being aboue other Bishops, and their Paſtor, he hath power to call, and to commaund them to meete in Councell, when the Generall Church-affaires doe require it; which no Byſshop or Patriarke beſides can doe, none of them all being Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all the reſt. Neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperour or any other ſecular Prince doe it: not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie, becauſe he is not Gouernour of the Church, or Church buſines; nor ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelie if by ſome principall cauſe he chance to moued thereunto; becauſe his power is not extended to the latitude of the Church, or ouer all Nations and all Biſshops what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, nor euer was. So that his commaund, vnto ſuch men as were out of his Dominions, were of no power to bringe them together, more then the commaund of the kinge of Spaine, or of the Spanish Biſshops, would
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:344:189"/> ſerue in France. When the Biſshops are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, the Pope ſtill remaines as he was before, their Paſtor, and their Foundation, and there-their director, their moderator, and Preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And this the Generall Councell of Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don did acknowledge in the Perſon of Leo, whom they ſtiled their <hi>Father</hi> and their <hi>Heade,</hi> and themſelues his <hi>Sonnes</hi> and his <hi>Members.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The Catholique Church allſo did euer acknowledge in the Pope this right of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, which <hi>I</hi> prooue by all the Generall Councells that euer yet haue bene.

But I muſt aduiſe you of the difficulties you are to finde herein, being ſuch, as greater Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers then I take you for, haue not bene able to ouercome.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Firſt therfore, you are to make it eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that in the Lateran Councell the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of the Pope is <hi>formallie</hi> defined, and that the words wherin it is attributed vnto him or acknowledged as belonging vnto him, haue the nature of a decree, for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell defines not euerie thing, which it ſaith. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> you are to make it euident,<note place="margin">reflect in whoſe time and where it was, how things ſtood in France &amp;c</note> that the Councell was Oecumenicall, and that it was open and free to all Bishops in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church. <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> you muſt make it euident that the decree of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance, is not limitted in circumſtances; and that it doth not ſpeake onelie of ſuch a Pope, as were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; or in caſe of Hereſie, or Schiſme, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutelie of any whatſoeuer. <hi>Fourthlie</hi> you muſt allſo make it euident that the decree was Oecumenicall, or the Generall Decree of the Church, and not of one Obedience onelie; other two not conſenting. Theſe are ſome
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:344:194"/> of the many, and obſcure difficulties, which hetherto learned men haue not bene able to ſee thorough: and therfore the truth in this Controuerſie lies hidden ſo as neither part is cleerelie knowne for a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Oecumenicall decree or definition: though you rashlie and moſt ignorantlie haue affirmed it of them both. Which you did to make shewe of good forme in your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, euerie one knowing that a contradiction betwixt Oecumenicall decrees, doth ſuppoſe that both parts contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting are Oecumenicall.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Another part of your argument is that ita is Contradiction: and this part muſt be prooued allſo, and made euident before your argument recouer ſtrength. But it is ſo farre out your power, that (ſuppoſe all the reſt were diſſembled) you could neuer be able to make it good: that is, to prooue and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that one is oppoſite or contradictorie to the other; and therfore you doe moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreetelie reiect the Authoritie of Generall Councells, reuerenced euer by the Church, and directed by Gods Spiritte, out of feare or apprehenſion of a contradiction, which in the Laterane and that of Conſtance you thinke you ſee. The Scholler who reiects Ariſtotle, or Iuſtinian, or the Bible for
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:344:194"/> euerie ſeeming contradiction, will neuer be good Philoſopher, nor good Lawier, nor good Deuine.</p>
               <p n="23">23. It is manifeſt by the acts of the of the Councell of Conſtance that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree whereon you inſiſt was at firſt not made by the whole Church; becauſe, of three Obediences which then were, One onelie, that is, Iohns Obedience or partie made it: the other Two not being vnited vnto them. So that if you take it as proceeding from thoſe onelie who firſt made it, it was not Oecumenicall. The other Obediences of Gregorie and Bennet vnited them ſelues afterwards: One in the 14. Seſſion,<note place="margin">Act. Conc.</note> the other in the 22. and the Church thus vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a Pope was choſen: ſo that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell now, that is, after the Vnion of all Obediences, and Election of the Pope, was Oecumenicall; and therfore what was now decreed anew, or approued though pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned before, was therby made Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. If therefore you can make it euident that the Councell and Pope at this tyme did approoue the decree before made, I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte that it is Oecumenicall, and beleeue it. Neither is there any reaſon I doe ſo before this appeares, becauſe decrees take their force
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:344:195"/> from the approbation of thoſe which haue authoritie, and not allwayes from the writer or conceauer. In Parlament, a conſtitution may be conceaued in the lower howſe, and agreed o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there; yet hath it not the true nature of a lawe till it paſſe the vpper howſe, and allſo be confirmed by the Kinge. So likewiſe this conſtitution conceaued and agreed on firſt by Iohns Obedience or adherents, hath not the nature and force of an Oecumenicall decree, till it paſſe the Generall Councell wherein the whole Church is vnited, and allſo be confirmed by the Pope.</p>
               <p n="23">23. That wee may ſee further the weaknes of your argument, ſince you cannot make it euident that the Canon made at Conſtance in the fourth Seſſion, was thus generallie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued and approued by the Councell when all Obediences were vnited; and there rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Pope: Let vs freelie and out of curteſie ſuppoſe it had bene ſo, and that the Pope were bound to obay the decrees of ſuch a Councell, in the things which the canon ſpeakes of, and further that in power it were Superiour vnto the Pope: all this would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt with the words of the other Councell, and both might be true. Theſe two propoſitions. <hi>A Councell perfectlie Oecumenicall</hi> and by the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:344:195"/> power of the See Apoſtolique approoued,<note place="margin">I doe not atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was when the Canon was conceaued but what it was when wee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Canon was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</note> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thereby repreſenting the Church perfectlie, and <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> as Philoſophers ſpeake, <hi>is aboue the Pope. A Councell vnperfectlie Oecumenicall</hi> as not being approoued by the Pope, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his power, and conſequentlie not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Church perfectlie, <hi>is not aboue the Pope.</hi> Theſe two propoſitions (I ſay) are not contradictorie nor Oppoſite, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they were defined, wee would beleeue them both.</p>
               <p n="24">24. If you should aske <hi>in that caſe,</hi> in whom, or in what formallie that power greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Popes, were; It <hi>would</hi> be anſweared, that it were not preciſelie in the Pope, nor preciſelie in the reſt, but in the whole, conſiſting of them all: as the ſowle is not preciſelie in the heade, nor preciſelie in the reſt of the bodie, but in the whole and compleate bodie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of heade, shoulders, armes, hart, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes in regard whereof, as when the bodie is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſunder and deuided the heade from the shoulders, the ſowle is in neither of the partes: euen ſo it <hi>would</hi> be ſaid <hi>in that caſe,</hi> that if you conſider the Pope, and the reſt of the Councell a part, this power were in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe it is the act, the forme, and the vertue of the whole, or of the Totalitie, to ſpeake as the Philoſophers doe. It would be
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:344:196"/> further anſwered that ſuch a full Councell had immediatelie the aſſiſtance of the All-teaching Spiritte, and power to binde and looſe, and the like by vertue of our Sauiours promiſe: yet ſo, that the Pope alone had power too ouer each in the Church, he being in S. Peeter made Paſtor of them all. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of which Inſtitution of our Sauiour all Catholiques agree in this, that the Pope is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to euerie Biſshoppe in the Church.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared the Pope, being a parte of a full and perfect Oecumenicall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, to the whole bodie or Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, wherein he was included as a part in the whole, as the heade in a perfect and entire bodie, it remaines now that wee deuide this Councell or perfect Bodie againe into <hi>two</hi> partes, by taking the heade from the reſt, and compare theſe partes together. In this diuiſion theſe parts are but two, one is the Pope, the other are the reſt of the Councell, which is vnperfect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a parte being without the Pope, as a mans bodie without a heade is but an vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect bodie, and indeed but a part. Of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in this ſenſe, the Lateran ſpeakes as the words themſelues do conuince euidentlie and it is among all men out of queſtion. So that if it were an Oecumenicall decree, the cleere ſenſe would be that the Pope were
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:344:196"/> aboue ſuch a Councell; and this wee would beleeue. Neither were there any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at all in this, to ſaie that <hi>one part is in power aboue the other:</hi> and that <hi>the whole is in power aboue either part.</hi> Reade ouer your Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke rules, examine well the nature of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, marke the termes, and you will ſee that it is true which I doe ſaie:<note place="margin">

As for your oppoſitions, they are ſent backe with this anſwere, that nature indeede cannot effect thoſe things, they are out of the ſpheare of her actiuitie, but the power of God is infinite, and the things in them ſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no contradiction: wherefore God can effect them. And being grounded in his word, wee beleeue them without more adoe. Man is not able with his wit to diſcouer all the wayes of God, or to comprehend the whole obiect of his power. Our knowledge wee gather from thoſe fewe things wee ſee, or perceaue by ſome exteriour se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of allmightie God is infinitelie aboue all this.

               <p n="35">35. But what is the thing you ſtumble at? Subſtance of it ſelfe is not determined to place, it hath this determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by accidents? by Quantitie, Localitie, Vbication. If God beſtowe on it ſupernaturallie two Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Vbications at once, it is at once in two places Sacramentallie; if a thouſand, it is in a thouſand places. Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall Exiſtencie, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be called, as Vbicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Preſence, or by what other name you will, is an Accident, and this Accident is the formall reaſon or cauſe of being preſent vnder the dimenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the roome of Breade. It is ſupernaturall to the body, and God hath power to produce many of theſe at once.</p>
               <p n="36">36. You replie that the very ſame thing cannot without contradiction be at once preſent in many dimenſions without being deuided. This is falſe, the thing may haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduation or vnitie in it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, and yet be in many dimenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s too. The ſoule of man is one and indiuiſible, and yet in the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:344:204"/> dimenſions of all the members of the body. That which is in the heade is in the feete, not a peece, for the ſoule hath no peeces, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiſible, but it is all in each part. God is heere and in heauen too, and, yet not deuided though betwixt this place and heauen there be many other things.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Againe you replie that the ſame bodie cannot be at once in many mouthes. But, why not, if it be at once in many dimenſions? The foule, an indiuiſible thing, is naturallie at once in many members, it is at once in the heade, hands, feete, fingers, and toes, and in each member all. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or diuiſion; why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not God whoſe power is infinite ſupernaturallie put one and the ſame Bodie at once in many mouthes? It is no contradiction, He may doe it. Meaſure not his power by your witte. The thing may be aboue your conceipt, no meruaile, it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall. The exiſtence of the ſowle in many members <hi>all,</hi> is naturall, Tell me firſt how this is done? It is in the heade and in the feete, yet hath no diſtance in it ſelfe. It is in manie fingers, yet one. It is in euerie part of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended bodie, and yet not extended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is in the hart, and in the ſides, in the tongue, and in the mouth that is round aboute it, it is in the heade, that doth compaſſe the braine and it is
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:344:204"/> within the braine <hi>all,</hi> vnles in your braine peraduenture it be not. Shall I now argue out of this that it is <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> and <hi>round aboute</hi> it ſelfe? if I meant to trouble an vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reader, and turne his braine as you doe, I would. When you haue made him vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theſe things touching the naturall exiſtence of his ſowle, he will be able to anſwere all that you can ſaie touching the ſupernaturall exiſtence of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt in many mouthes; and if he doth not yet vnderſtand that, being naturall, no maruaile if he doth not vnderſtand this Myſterie, it being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall.</p>
               <p n="38">38. The other peece of your difficultie is, that a bodie is naturallie extended, and a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bodie fills a greate place, therefore it cannot be within that little roome. I anſwere, that ſubſtance <hi>of it ſelfe</hi> fills no place, but by an Accident called Situall extenſion or Locali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as, by it ſelfe it is not viſible, but by a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Colour. Theſe Accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are diſtinct from the Subſtance: they are not Subſtance. If God take away the Colour, or will not let it mooue the eie, the ſubſtance is not ſeene: if God take away the Localitie, it filles no place; He is the Creator and may doe as he liſt. The Bodie of our Sauiour in the Sacrament hath not ſituall extenſion or Localitie, it ſucceeds into the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:344:205"/> roome of breade. Before, breade was vnder thoſe dimenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which you ſee, and the body ſucceeds to bread, wherefore the body is now vnder the ſame. It is true that the nature of a bodie requires extenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but God is Author of nature, and needs nor paie but when he pleaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is abſolute. Humane nature hath a proper ſubſiſtence due vnto it, yet in Chriſt it hath none but diuine.</p>
               <p n="39">39. To your queſtion how this is donne, I anſwere that other Infidels had the like diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in other matters, as how he who filles heauen and earth should be in a Mothers armes, a little child Almightie God. Do you vnderſtand how this doth come to paſſe? how is the indiuiſible Subſtance of God in each part of the world <hi>all?</hi>

               <p n="40">40. FOr the Reall Preſence out of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie are cited Iuſtinus the Martyr, Ireneus, Tertullia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Hilarius, both the Cyrills, Ambroſe, Epiphanius, Heſichius, Optatus, Auguſtine, Ierom, Leo, Gregorie and others by Zanchez, Coccius, Garetius and Gualte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. Your anſwere is that all are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode of a figuratiue, and not a reall Preſence. You thinke the Bodie and Blood are in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onelie and no neerer: but <hi>wine</hi> and <hi>breade</hi> you ſay are equiuocallie called the <hi>blood</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die</hi> though they be indeede nothing els but ſignes. This deuice doth not ſatisfie. For the Fathers haue directlie expreſſed all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a reall Preſence to the verie laſt; and will not be <hi>contented</hi> with your figure. This I delare.</p>
               <p n="41">41. <hi>Firſt</hi> becauſe in conceauing the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a ſigne, there is no difficultie, it was eaſie to ſay, and for men to vnderſtand that breade was a ſigne or figure of the bodie, if our Sauiour had meant onelie this, but the Fathers apprehende in the Euchariſt a great
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:344:207"/> and incomprehenſible Myſterie. I will cite one or two leaſt you denie it, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame manner of proceeding to the end of this Chapter. S. Chryſoſtom ſpeaketh thus. <hi>Good Lord what a wonderfull miracle is this?</hi>

                  <hi>In ſaying the Euchariſt I open all the treaſure of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> S. Ephrem. <hi>Why doſt thou ſearch things that are vnſearchable? If thou diue curiouſlie into theſe matters thou shalt not be called faithfull but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. Be thou faithfull and innocent, receaue the vnſpotted bodie of this Lord with an entire faith, being aſſured that thou eateſt the lambe himſelfe entire. The Myſteries of Chriſt are immortall fire: ſearch them not rashlie, leaſt in their ſearch thou be burned. This truely which the onelie begotten ſonne Chriſt our Sauiour hath donne for vs, ſurpaſſeth all admiration, all thought, and all ſpeach: for he hath giuen vs fire and Spirit to be eaten and dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:344:208"/> that is, his body and his Blood.</hi> Hence I argue thus. If the Fathers did apprehend in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt a greate and vnſearchable myſterie, they apprehended more then breade and wine with a relation vnto the bodie and blood, this being an eaſie thing and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible; but the Fathers did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the Euchariſt a great and vnſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Myſterie, as you haue heard; therefore more then bread and wine with a relation to the bodie and blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="42">42. <hi>Secondlie.</hi> The Fathers ſaie that bread and wine are changed into the bodie and blood of Chriſt.

               <p n="62">62. <hi>A ſecond</hi> argument I make out of the iudgment of the Fathers and the Church Primitiue. If the Fathers did beleeue that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſecration the things propoſed were breade a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wine, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that after conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon breade a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wine, but the bodie and blood of Chriſt, then did thoſe Fathers beleeue an inward ſubſtantiall change in thoſe formes; for this comes not to paſſe without a change, as he who beleeues the drinke in the cuppe to be water when it is brought to the table, and afterwards to be wine and nor water, doth acknowledge a change; for were
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:344:219"/> there no mutation it would be ſtill as it was at firſt, water and not wine. But the Fathers did beleeue that thoſe things before conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration were breade and wine, as you alſo do confeſſe, and that after conſecration there was not breade and wine in thoſe formes, but the bodie and blood of Chriſt, as I haue declared in the former Chapter; therefore thy belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an inward change.</p>

It is a figure and repreſenteth, by reaſon of the exteriour forme: the ſubſtance couered with this forme: is the ſame. The ſecond perſon, the ſonne of God is ſaid by S.

               <p n="67">67. Your argument againſt the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, is out of S.

If it be not ſacrificed in the forme of a liuing thing, but in the forme of another thing that doth not liue, as in the forme of breade and wine, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> killing is not neceſſarie; Conſecration inducing the <hi>bodie</hi> vnder <hi>one forme:</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> vnder <hi>another,</hi> is ſufficient.

The Decrees of generall Councells were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued before Caluin had any Schoole, and will be when he hath neuer a Scholler.
